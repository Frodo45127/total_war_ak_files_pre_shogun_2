<short_description>A national army requires central organisation, if only for pay and rations. Regiments may be the preserve of their commanding officers, but the functionaries control the purse strings!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn army generates paperwork of all kinds, and a secretariat grows to keep it all in order. There is an obvious need to make sure that units receive orders and supplies in a timely manner – and without unscrupulous suppliers stealing too much money. Headquarters staff must also organise transport in co-operation with the navy, keep a list of officers and their commissions, organise parades to impress the great and the good, and offer assistance to the civil power in times of need. \n\nHistorically, European armies were organised in an ad hoc fashion in the 18th Century. Usually, the biggest permanent formations in existence were regiments; armies were assembled as-and-when a crisis loomed under the command of favoured general. Even so, the concept of the central command telling colonels what to do with their regiments often met stiff opposition. The Ottoman and Mughal empires were better organised in theory, and did have larger permanent formations such as corps and divisions.</long_description>

<short_description>This is the centre of the army’s bureaucracy, where clerks and secretaries of state labour to make the fighting soldiers’ lives as awkward as possible!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is a truism that soldiers have little time for the bureaucrats who send them their orders. Some organisation above the level of a regiment is, however, a necessary evil: supplies must be purchased and distributed, transport organised, officers’ promotion lists kept in order, and generals given their orders. All this means paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork! Money, and the power to spend it, are vitally important and all government secretariats are keen to hold on to both.\n\nHistorically, the government departments that ran armies in the 18th Century were far from being defence ministries or anything approaching a general staff. A central war planning function was almost unheard of, and often generals were quite unwilling to deal with the authorities at home, preferring to control everything themselves. In Europe the army organisations dealt with pay and rations: often spending time making sure that colonels did really raise regiments they were being paid for! The Ottomans were much more organised, and their armies were on a professional footing and raised on a national basis, even if some of the units raised were rather old fashioned.</long_description>

<key>army_staff_college_european</key>
<short_description>This institution educates soldiers in more advanced aspects of warfare, not just in the theory of tactics.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTactics may win battles, but wars are won thanks to information, strategy and, above all, supply. An army that is unfed and lost is no use to anyone. An army staff college produces officers with the skills needed to deal with the many details involved in keeping an army in the field. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers are taught military illustration (the vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams), some surveying, military law, how to behave like a proper gentleman (regrettably necessary in some cases), horsemanship, weapons handling and given character-building instruction. The end product is a man who can be an aide to a general in all situations.\n\nHistorically, the British, for example, had an inherent distrust of armies as tools of tyranny, and this may have contributed to the low priority given to raising professional standards. Pupils had to fund their studies from their own pockets at the Royal Military College! This had an additional advantage, of course, in ensuring that only candidates from the “right” social classes could afford to attend. Other nations were not so suspicious of giving soldiers necessary military skills.</long_description>

<key>artillery_park_european</key>
<short_description>An artillery park is a store for cannons, howitzers and mortars and their associated equipment; everything an artilleryman could need for his trade is here!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSmall arms may turn a rabble into a rebellion, but cannons create an army. Governments rightly want a monopoly on the ownership of heavy guns, and rightly see them as a measure of national power. A lack of guns severely hampers any military force, limiting it to little more than skirmish actions.\n\nOnce cast, artillery barrels could spend decades in storage. Providing that they were dry, there was little chance that they would come to much harm. When needed, a barrel was fitted to a gun carriage, ammunition and a limber found, and a piece was ready. Cannons could also be remade by fitting the barrel to a different carriage: a cannon for fortress use was mounted differently to a field gun.\n\nFire in an artillery park was a constant risk, bringing the danger of explosions, but damp conditions would ruin powder stocks just as surely. Water turned powder in a porridge, which then had to be dried very carefully and “corned” – turned into smooth grains of the right size – once again. Drying and crushing spoiled gunpowder was a ticklish task!</long_description>

<key>barracks_european</key>
<short_description>Barracks provide more than simple housing blocks for regular military forces. The buildings also serve to remind the local people who is in charge. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThey are a statement in brick and stone that the military are present to defend the state and keep order. Usually constructed around a drill square, they are a carefully segregated military world deliberately kept apart from the civilians beyond. The walls present a blank, defensible, and intimidating face to the outside world. It can be important to keep troops away from the assorted temptations of flesh and the bottle. Civilians also harbour unsuitable, unmilitary ideas of disobedience and disloyalty – there must be limits to what an army can permit its men to think!\n\nHistorically, in Europe the fashion for building barrack blocks seemed to mirror the fascination with the Classical World of Greece and Rome. Among its other achievements, the Roman army had standardised designs for military buildings; armies in the 18th Century began to be similarly standardised. Governments employed good architects too: Nicholas Hawksmoor, for example, built the garrison barracks at Berwick-upon-Tweed for the British government. He was almost the equal of Sir Christopher Wren in talent if not in lasting fame, and produced many fine churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire of London.</long_description>

<short_description>Janissary barracks are the recruiting, training and housing centres for the most feared soldiers in the Ottoman army. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe janissaries are the “yeni cheri” (literally the “new soldiers”) although they are the earliest organised, regularly paid, state army in existence in Europe. Recruited as child soldiers from among the non-Muslims of the Ottoman world, indoctrination produces superb warriors and unquestioningly loyal state functionaries. \n\nThe long, proud and bloody tradition of janissary victory and excessive zeal was a result and a cause of an almost-monastic training regime. This tradition as a “warrior order” influenced in turn the ascetic architectural style of their barracks. That, at least, is the theory. Lacking local loyalties, and having had their family ties broken, they became the “enforcers of empire” as well as its defenders because they had no reason to be sympathetic towards anyone not in their ranks.\n\nHistorically, however, the janissaries did not remain elite warriors and nothing else. They extended their reach into all aspects of the state bureaucracy, practiced a variety of trades and professions in addition to soldiering, and often lived a less-than-celibate lifestyle. They also became conservative in outlook and a real obstacle to any kind of political, military or social reform.</long_description>

<key>cannon_foundry_european</key>
<short_description>Cannon foundries not only make guns, but also ammunition and the associated equipment for artillerymen. They are hot, dangerous places to work. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe casting of early cannons is more of an art than a science, and few of the weapons produced are standardised pieces. This is the result of casting limitations, the quality of iron or bronze available, and the manufacturing process (cannon casting was an adaptation of bell making). Most 6-pounders would be around the right calibre, but no two were truly identical. It was enough that the cannon did not burst and kill its crew, and hurled a shot in the general direction of the enemy. \n\nCannon foundries are also responsible for making the ball shot used by the weapons, but not the powder. No one but a raving lunatic would make gunpowder anywhere near a foundry, with the risk of stray sparks and consequent catastrophe! That said, making guns, like any casting work, is a dangerous business: if the sand moulds are even slightly damp then a steam explosion can occur. Anyone nearby is likely to be killed or maimed by hot metal and pieces of the mould. \n\nIn 1716, an explosion at the English foundry in Moorfields killed and injured many people when metal was poured into a damp mould. Among those hurt were Colonel Armstrong, the Surveyor-General of Ordnance. The foundry itself was totally destroyed.</long_description>

<short_description>A college offers an academic education – a veneer of civilized sophistication – to the sons of the aristocracy and gentry.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA college education is expensive, and there are few charity-funded places or scholarships for the less socially fortunate. It is a privileged man who goes to college: money or patronage are needed more than intellect. Although there is discussion and teaching of the radical ideas of science and philosophy to the students, the college masters are likely to have a conservative outlook. Most of the students are the same: they are from the top rungs of society’s ladder, and they have little interest in seeing the natural “status quo” altered.\n\nHistorically, attending college was probably the most boring element in the education of “young gentlemen”, although the actual work required was not that arduous. The “Grand Tour” became fashionable during the 18th Century, when the rich would wander Italy (Greece being an Ottoman possession), taking in the sites of Antiquity and the great works of the Renaissance. In the process they would spend a fortune on Classic-period statuary and relics, paintings by the great masters, and anything else that took their fancy. Quite reasonably, the less aesthetically refined, but well funded, would seek an exotic “education” in local taverns and bawdyhouses!</long_description>

<short_description>A college offers an academic, secular education to the sons of the wealthy and influential.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is expensive and exclusive, but provides a good basis for a career in both private business and the state administration. Society does not expect the college to be a hotbed of radical ideas, but to produce able, polished men who can occupy the highest positions with confidence. If nothing else, the personal contacts made will be extremely useful to a graduate, even if his academic attainments are a little lacking.\n\nThere is also a distinctly Turkish flavour to the education on offer, as Ottoman culture and achievements are (rightly, in the view of both teaching staff and students) celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is the legacy of an education here. This is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.\n\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire was always in need of able administrators. This was one of the reasons why it came to rely on the disciplined and educated military corps of janissaries to act as imperial functionaries. This, in turn, caused problems as the janissaries became more interested in their own perquisites than in their duties as civilian officials.</long_description>

<key>commercial_basin_european</key>
<short_description>With the addition of exchanges, shipping agents, customs houses, even more warehouses and even more docks, a basin becomes an economic powerhouse. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA commercial basin opens up new opportunities for trade, as agents now put together cargoes and charter vessels for merchants who would otherwise be unable to trade. Money, rather than sea experience, becomes the driving force for success, and trade does not even need to go through the basin to make money for the men of property!\n\nThe infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool in England, Africa and the Caribbean sugar islands is possibly one of the most profitable trades ever invented. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in the most horrendous conditions imaginable, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum for the run back to Britain. There was a handsome profit on each leg, and the ships were never idle. Even better, the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool never needed to see the suffering their commerce caused, always assuming that they cared.</long_description>

<short_description>Adding warehouses additional docks and even the services of the excisemen to a port increases the amount of trade that can be done. Now cargoes can be consolidated and shipped onwards.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nShipping goods to a home market is only one way of making money from trade. There is more to be earned from shipping valuable goods to new markets in other countries. The ability to warehouse an incoming cargo and only release it when the price is right also increases profits.\n\nMost maritime nations – Britain and Holland in particular – had rules that enforced a native nationals-only rule for carrying goods into their ports. Anything, for example, that arrived in the Port of London should have come in a “British bottom”. This kind of protectionism in trade also applied to colonies and indirectly caused at least one war, the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-48), between Spain and Britain. The Spanish were alleged to have chopped off the ear when Jenkins was caught trading in Spanish territory; the British had previously agreed a treaty not to do this. The war became part of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-48) but, incidentally, marks the first public occasion that “God Save the King” was used as the British national anthem, to celebrate the capture of Puerto Bello in Panama by Admiral Vernon.</long_description>

<short_description>A conservatorium is a school for musicians, specialising in the highly cultured music required for church and state occasions. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile the emphasis is on music for a cultured and upper class audience, the education provided by a conservatorium is practical and vocational. Those who pay the fees intend to earn a living as musicians, at the very least in the orchestra of a wealthy patron and, at best, as a composer of some renown, able to choose between commissions, patrons and even nations! A conservatorium has to provide what its customers want, and they generally produce well-polished musicians who can pass themselves off, when needed, as professionals or members of the minor gentry.\n\nHistorically, many of these schools began as either royal academies of music or choristers’ schools for the great cathedrals. All music had to be performed live, and the need for new, innovative and exciting music at every state or religious event required an enormous number of musicians – and talented composers with prodigious work rates! Great composers, such as Mozart or Handel, were celebrities and royal houses outbid each other in an effort to obtain their services as a prestigious ornament to a court.</long_description>

<short_description>Calligraphy is the art of writing and, by extension, the art of producing books. It is a worthy accomplishment to produce beautiful script. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe art of calligraphy and the skill of writing beautifully are important because they preserve and communicate the revelations of the Qur&apos;an. \n\nThe work of calligraphers is prized and collected for its inherent beauty, as well as its meaning. The mastery of the many styles and forms is a lifetime’s work, but one that can bring rich rewards. A student cannot sign work until he had received an “icazet” or diploma, granted for producing an examination piece in the presence of several teachers. Standards are exceptionally high, but a recognized calligrapher could expect to have his work treasured by his clients.\n\nCalligraphy also forms the basis of some Islamic decoration (along with geometric arabesque art) and has a figurative style where interweaved words create images. These “calligrams” are both intricate and incredibly beautiful artworks. Calligraphy also has influences on other artistic endeavours, such as the creation of elaborate carpets and textiles.</long_description>

<short_description>A dockyard can carry out major shipbuilding work, and usually includes a large number of associated artisans and tradesmen from coopers to victuallers. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDockyards also have extensive shore facilities, such as ropewalks, forges, furnaces and, possibly most important of all, seasoning sheds. Using “green” timber for shipbuilding results in vessels that can “work” (have a little flexibility), something that French shipbuilders regard as a good thing, even though it means that their ships leak in heavy seas. Seasoning wood for months or years is prudent, and most other navies follow this practice.\n\nOn more than one occasion in the century Royal Navy raiding parties made a point of destroying stocks of timber – in particular masts – stored in enemy dockyards. The loss of timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to make good too. Burning timber rather than stealing it must have gone against the natural inclinations of many RN officers and seamen, as their prize money for the goods was also going up in smoke!</long_description>

<short_description>A drill school creates the common practices for an army, and turns a collection of disparate forces into a precise and clockwork killing machine.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn an age when all battlefield manoeuvres must be performed exactly, drill is a necessary part of all military training. Constant repetition of the actions involved in loading and firing a piece are useful in themselves, but of more use is the unthinking obedience to superiors that is, literally, drilled into every man in the ranks. When a soldier is concentrating on his place in line and on not attracting the attention of his sergeant or officer, he will not worry about what the enemy might be doing. Drill has another benefit for an army too: men busy on the parade ground cannot be getting into trouble or finding a tavern!\n\nIn Britain, one aspect of 18th Century drill survives to this day in the form of a ceremonial parade called “Trooping the Colour”, carried out on the monarch’s official birthday on Horse Guards, in London. Originally, this parade was not a celebration but a practical exercise: the men needed to know what “the colours”, or flags, of their unit looked like. The fact that the monarch gets to review the soldiers is not the point! In battle, the men would need to be able to rally to, and then defend, these colours on command.</long_description>

<short_description>A dry dock is a large brick or stone basin with a set of watertight gates. Once a ship has floated in, the lock gates are shut and the dock drained. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWithin the dry dock, the ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge firmly upright as the water is removed. By carefully timing the movement of a ship to take advantage of high and low tides, the amount of pumping (by hand) is minimised. Movements into and out of the dock are tidal, and work must be finished by the next high tide. \n\nThe advantages of being able to work on a warship and then float it away are considerable. Dry docks are equally useful for construction and repair, and are often at the centre of a large complex of workshops specialising in every aspect of shipbuilding.\n\nThe organisation required for all this activity means that the craft-based skills of the master shipwright are still valuable, but naval architects producing plans, drawings and schedules are now a vital part of the process. Naturally, the master of the docks can treat the entire enterprise as his own (as long as he delivers the ships needed) and award contracts as he sees fit to his friends and cronies! Officials making profits from the government’s investment was an accepted cost of business and, provided the men were not too greedy, an assurance that they were looking after their interests and those of the navy!</long_description>

It is their lot to position guns and advise when a breach in a fortress’ walls is “practicable”, and could fall to an assault.\n\nSappers and miners, like artillery experts, had long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods; siege works needed experts to demolish castle walls. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and pioneers, of course!</long_description>

<short_description>A wooden artillery fort is a significant defensive structure, reinforced to allow guns to fire from the walls.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has a strong wall and parapet that is set with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire at attackers.\n\nThe repeated firing of even quite small artillery pieces puts a tremendous strain on any structure. An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. A wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force. Its imposing walls also give notice that its builders intend to keep the land they own.</long_description>

<short_description>An artillery fort is a permanent defensive structure, mounting as many heavy guns as the builders can afford to emplace.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has strong walls and parapets with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. Properly served and loaded with canister shot, guns turn the fort’s approaches into death traps for any attacking force.\n\nThe fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and the recoil of its own pieces. Firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on any structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.\n\nHistorically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion.</long_description>

<short_description>A star fort is a system of bastions with interlocking fields of fire: an intimidating obstacle to any attacker!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe layout of the star fort, with its projecting bastions, creates fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous fire. The star shape evolved so that no part of the approaches would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing field for the defenders.\n\nIn the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.</long_description>

<short_description>This imposing fort is a difficult objective for any attacker, and a clear symbol of power!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBy European standards, this fortress looks like a relic from an earlier age, but to underestimate the defences would be very foolish. Packed earth ramparts behind the thick, high walls not only give extra fighting space to the defenders, but also deaden enemy cannon fire, absorbing the impact of shot and shell. Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.\n\nHistorically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The quality of workmanship demanded was extremely high, even palatial in its luxurious attention to detail.</long_description>

<short_description>Mining is a dirty, dangerous business. Men hack out all manner of valuable minerals by hand, risking life and limb for the mine owners’ profits. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLit only by candles (which they must buy themselves) or lamps with naked flames, most miners are labouring in conditions that resemble hell on earth. In some mines firedamp (methane) is a constant risk thanks to the candles – an explosion can happen at any time. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any explosion. \n\nThere are also accidents. Miners are paid only for the valuable minerals that they extract, so there is little incentive to carry out much work for safety’s sake. Pit props may keep the roof from collapsing, but putting them in does not earn any payment – the miners may even be charged for the materials! And it is not just men who labour below ground. Women often pull carts from the working face to the surface. Children need less space and air than adults, and make ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and bringing food and water to the miners. In smaller seams, children are the perfect labourers.\n\nAll of this is secondary, however, to the business of making money, and mining can be a very profitable industry.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive setting for musical performances allows the audience to delight in novel entertainments, and admire the good taste of the house’s patron.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLittle expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the “front of house” areas where the audience are to be found. A grand opera house is a magnificent structure, the equal of any palace in terms of luxurious appointments and detailing to overawe the visitors. The staged works can be equally elaborate, featuring enormous casts and intricate settings. This is conspicuous consumption raised to a high art, even before the music starts!\n\nMany rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. The staging and music of opera advanced tremendously during the period, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel, and Scarlatti. Emperor Joseph II of Austria, the “music king”, was particularly fortunate that his love of the art coincided with a flowering of musical talent in Europe. He used the arts as a subtle tool of nationalism, promoting a Germanic culture within Austria.</long_description>

<short_description>Formal gardens are a place of quiet contemplation, where the cares and burdens of the state can be set aside for a while. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe tulip is a native flower of, among other places, Anatolia, and the flower has long been prized by the Ottomans. Planted in formal gardens, the design of which owes much to the Persian “paradise garden”, they are a spectacular display of shapes and colour. The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that.\n\nDespite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on specimens that hadn’t even been planted or grown! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the speculation had to stop; the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many penniless. The tulip, fortunately, remains a popular garden plant to this day, although thankfully without the financial jiggery-pokery! Gardeners with too much money did pay high prices for tulip bulbs in the 18th Century although these were for planting, not financial speculation.</long_description>

<key>great_arsenal_european</key>
<short_description>A great arsenal is a government-owned factory, intended to manage the manufacturing and development of long guns and all the paraphernalia needed. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, but central control of heavy artillery and its production is a wise policy. Rebels without cannons are an annoyance: with large guns, rebels can become revolutionaries!\n\nLarge guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery train.\n\nHistorically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot and powder; domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on a carriage and used in anger. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners. Money for the upkeep of stores also caused problems, too often ending up in the pockets of the Masters of Ordnance and his friends!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nSome objects in the collection are the spoils of war, gifts from travellers, the items collected on the whims of past rulers, and intriguing curios from around the world. This is, in many ways, the national equivalent of a savant’s “cabinet of curiosities”: a miscellany of interesting things, collected simply because they were interesting. The other half of the collection is a clear demonstration of national prowess in all fields, be that a piece of intricate machinery, a work of superlative craftsmanship, the largest cannon in the world, and so on. It is understandable if a certain chauvinism creeps into the enterprise: it is an exercise in national trumpet-blowing!\n\nHistorically, private museums and displays had developed from the collections in “cabinets of curiosities”, and some of these had ended up as government or royal property. The world-famous British Museum began in just this way, when Sir Hans Sloane’s collection was left to George II so that it could be preserved for the nation. Now a wonderful collection of antiquities, the Museum was intended to be a universal collection, and had natural history, geology, and science exhibits.</long_description>

<key>gunnery_school_european</key>
<short_description>A practical education in the arts of gunnery and the uses of firepower can be a very useful thing for an officer of artillery.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGunners see themselves as a “race apart” from army officers, and with good reason. They are skilled specialists who have spent years studying their trade. In the wrong hands, cannons can be as dangerous to their users as to the enemy, so gunners are actually expected to know what they are about. Unlike army officers, who have often obtained their rank through the purchase of a commission, gunners are promoted on seniority and merit. It is not enough to stand around looking brave; a gunner needs to understand military surveying and drawing, mathematics, ballistics, some military engineering, and have a grasp of technical matters. This can create tensions between “gentlemen” officers and the gunners practicing “a trade”.\n\nHistorically, many corps of artillery and gunnery schools are older than national standing armies, as they can date their foundations back to the times when a Master of Ordnance or Artillery was part of a royal household. The most famous artillery student is, of course, Napoleon Bonaparte; his interest was considered surprising given his background as a member of the minor nobility.</long_description>

<short_description>Mining is only part of the process of extracting wealth from the ground. Once on the surface, the ore must be processed and smelted. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nFor a mine owner to gain the maximum profit from his investment, as much usable material as possible must be extracted from the ore. This means that a large number of processes must be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore will need to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks need a large number of workers, and women and children do the work while their men labour in the depths. Even away from the shafts, the work is dangerous and deaths and injuries are not uncommon. It is also unhealthy work too: dust is ever present, and the fumes from smelting works are often poisonous. \n\nA large mine workings poisons the land and water for miles around, and turns pleasant countryside into a wasteland of spoil heaps and toxic ponds. This does not matter, as long as profit continues.</long_description>

<short_description>A madras is an Islamic place of learning, where Muslims can study not only their faith, but also the law, jurisprudence, science and history.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese schools are often attached to mosques, but they do not offer religious instruction alone. Those who wish to do so may study the Qur’an, and become honoured as a “hafiz” when they have memorised the whole text. Others may choose a wider syllabus and learn additional subjects such as history, logic, Shari’ah law, the Hadith – the recorded sayings and deeds of the Prophet, peace be upon him – and correct interpretation of the Qur’an. Those who finish their studies will gain status as scholars and imams, and become leaders in the wider community expected to interpret the law and religion for their fellow Muslims.\nHistorically, some madrassas offered their pupils an even wider choice of subjects, including Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch and other useful trade languages as well as science, mathematics and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, often better prepared for later studies than the counterparts in Europe. There were even madrassas that specialised as medical schools.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nLaw and order are the basis of good, bad and indifferent government. Appointed as a judge for his local standing, the magistrate of a region often acts as an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, leader in charitable good works, military recruiter and father figure to his community. A magistrate usually represents both the state and the landed classes. It is his task, as often as not, to protect the rights of property rather than of people, even when a republican regime is in power – liberty and equality are all very well, but the deserving rich need to be sure their wealth is safe!\n\nMagistrates also often have the power to raise troops as formed units, and to send convicted men into the military as a punishment. The magistrate, therefore, becomes the first line of defence against the mob in times of disorder.</long_description>

<short_description>A military academy is a training establishment for young officers, those who must rely on talent, rather than connections or wealth, for preferment.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn most countries, military command is limited to those in the ruling classes. There is a quite sensible belief that only those with a stake in the survival of society will defend it properly. However, there are counter-arguments to the effect that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, no matter how well connected, are not good enough. Military academies, therefore, teach the theory and practice of the military sciences. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as common tradesmen because of their knowledge.\n\nThe French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and lead the way in military teaching with the creation of an “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen” which subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. By contrast, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided an education for the orphans of serving officers, with no more than the hope that the pupils would go into the army. The Ottoman military system included the Janissaries, a class of warrior-administrators, selected and indoctrinated as children, who effectively ran the Ottoman Empire.</long_description>

<short_description>This is a centre of learning and original thought, where the sciences and arts of Mankind are extended.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe investigation of the universe, and disputation over the results, are not done out of any sense of altruism, of course. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the work undertaken. Personal pride and ambition are also stern taskmasters. But what is significant is that the ideas, theories and facts generated at the university are not kept within the academic elite. This flowering of learning informs and inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen too. The practical benefits of the advances made here percolate out into the wider national society, improving life for the ordinary people in ways both small and dramatic.\n\nIn the 18th Century great universities and the great minds they attracted were sources of nationalistic pride. Sir Isaac Newton was lauded across Europe for his work at Cambridge in England. The University of Gottingen aided the development of “German-ness” by publishing research and standard texts in German as well as Latin (the traditional language of learning). Gottingen was also unusual in, rather daringly, letting lecturers teach any book without reference to the State or Church!</long_description>

<short_description>An opera house is a sumptuous theatre for the performance of highly stylized musical plays. Society figures attend to be seen rather than for amusement.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nNo expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. An opera house rivals many great palaces with the luxury of its fixtures and fittings, as these public areas for the audience are more important than the entertainment. Theatrical contrivances and mechanical tricks may make the staging as grand as the music, but for the elite it is the gossip, plotting and backbiting that is the real pleasure of a night at the opera.\n\nIn the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that has (mercifully) ended is the use of castrati singers: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range.</long_description>

<short_description>There are rich traditions in the Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic arts that are valued by the educated and wealthy. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIndia is the birthplace of many cultures and arts, and the ruling classes have enough money to demand – and pay for – the best of everything. This creates a demand for skilled artisans of many kinds, and a demand for training in the arts from rich dilettantes who wish to dabble for themselves and, after all, an educated patron can spend his money wisely. There are schools specialising in every art, from erotic temple statuary to manuscript illumination – and everything in between.\n\nHistorically, some of the finest buildings and artistic achievements in India were created during the period of Mughal rule, in a style that can be called Islamo-Indian. The Islamic Mughal ruling class appreciated the skills of their Hindu subjects, and made full use of them in creating a rich and beautiful environment. At places like Lahore Fort, later rulers continued the tradition of architectural and artistic excellence.</long_description>

<short_description>Poetry is a form of literature held in high regard throughout the Turkish, Persian and Arab-speaking world by all the educated classes of society.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe styles and hidden allegorical meanings of poems take much time to master, and there is a rich set of traditions to draw on from all three languages.\n\nOttoman “divan” poetry uses Persian forms and many borrowed words (as Turkish does not suit Persian rhyming schemes). Arab poetry can be a great many styles, some of which need careful handling if they are not to offend religious sensibilities. Poetry can distract from proper Islamic studies, as well as praise God. A school of poetry teaches all of these nuances, and provides a grounding for those who wish to become court poets, a rewarding position for those who have talent.\n\nFinding a patron is, of course, a matter for the individual students, and a good grasp of calligraphic styles can help too. Being literate and having a beautiful style of penmanship is truly something to be treasured.</long_description>

<short_description>A sacred site where a tribe can honour its fallen warriors for all time.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.\n\nBurial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on.</long_description>

<short_description>This council of state is charged with looking after all matters relating to the production and use of artillery.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe committee is in charge of the design, development, casting and storage of artillery pieces for all the armed forces. The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, all too often with the bureaucratic muddle and rivalry that this can cause. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and yet a measure of national power.\n\nHistorically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. His duties of looking after the king’s artillery train eventually required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance, depending on the state involved, and they extended their responsibilities to take in the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the army and navy.</long_description>

<key>ordnance_factory_european</key>
<short_description>An ordnance factory is a large-scale enterprise dedicated to the design and manufacture of guns and their associated equipment for the army and navy. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly often retained by the state, even in a republic: there is no need for anyone other than a government to own large cannons! The creation of large guns is also a difficult and expensive business, and the state is the only authority that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns (rather than buy them from foreigners) is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory adds lustre and firepower to armies.\n\nHistorically, most ordnance factories began as royal establishments, giving the crown in each nation a source of cannons. These were needed for reducing the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. The royal household or near-ministerial status of the Master Gunner or Master of the Ordnance is proof that artillery was an important part of national or royal prestige. Size really did matter! The Ottoman Turks had a strong tradition of artillery production, in particular heavy siege guns.</long_description>

<key>pNavy1_shipyard_european</key>
<short_description>A dockyard gives a region a basic shipbuilding capability, and allows the construction of smaller warships.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDockyards are small industrial villages in their own right, and usually have all the tradesmen and artisans needed to get a ship built on site and permanently employed. They have extensive workshops such as ropewalks, smithies, sawmills and furnaces; the skilled craftsmen include coopers, sailmakers, chandlers and master carpenters. There are also large stocks of timber held in seasoning sheds. Seasoning, the process of slowly drying out sap, can take months or years, so wood is laid up anticipating future demands.\n\nHistorically, losing a dockyard to enemy action, even for a short time during a raid, was often a disaster. Apart from the damage to ships in harbour, the loss of timber stocks was far, far worse. The fixed workshops could be replaced, given money, but the timber was gone for good. Loss of these stocks set back shipbuilding by many years, and meant that battle damage was hard to repair. It must have gone against the instincts of many naval officers to burn a dockyard and its contents rather than loot it and purloin any ships for prize money, but they did it anyway!</long_description>

<short_description>A dry dock is a man-made basin with a set of watertight gates. It allows the construction of many types of warships.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA ship can be floated into the dock on a high tide, then the gates shut and the basin pumped out. The ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge it upright as the water is drained. Workers are then free to work on the hull as required. Careful timing takes account of the tides to minimise the amount of manual pumping needed, but this does mean that work is constrained by time and tide. Like many industrial enterprises, working conditions are harsh, and a drydock adds to the misery of the lower, working classes in the region.\n\nIn practice, drydocks not only aided repairs, but also construction. A ship could be laid down, and then simply floated away when complete. Ship design became limited by the size of the stone or brick basin of a dock. All this work was overseen by a master shipwright and a naval architect, who often treated even state-owned docks as their personal businesses. It was not unusual for dock officials to sub-contract their friends and cronies for work, in exchange for handsome commissions, introductory fees and simple bribery!</long_description>

<key>pNavy3_steam_drydock_european</key>
<short_description>A steam drydock is a basin for shipbuilding and repair that can be pumped dry by steam power. Steam engines also power much machinery.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is a magnificent achievement of industry: a manufactory for ships where men work amid the flames of engines and furnaces to produce warships of tremendous size and power. Beam engines are used to pump water out of docks, but other engines are used to power sawmills, lathes, block-making machines and dockside cranes: where craftsmen would once have laboured, heavy machinery does their work. Like much steam industry, however, it is also a horrible and dangerous place to work, and a steam drydock does less than nothing to make the lower classes of a region feel happy.\n\nHistorically, the technology for draining drydocks was simply that used to pump water out of mines: the problem and the solution were identical. However, once steam power was in traditional docks, its uses quickly spread, simply because of the work needed to keep a fleet in operation. By the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the British Royal Navy was the largest industrial organisation in the world, let alone the largest combat force. The admirals, for all their love of tradition, were always quick to appreciate any new development that strengthened their beloved service.</long_description>

<short_description>The Albertina is a collection of antiquities and objects that are the glory of Vienna.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOriginally constructed as a palace by Count Emanuel Teles Silva-Tarouca on top of one of Vienna’s bastions, the count must have used his influence as master of the Court Construction Office, otherwise the defences might have been left in place. The building subsequently came into the possession of Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen, the former governor of the Netherlands. He brought his extensive collection of artwork and antiquities back to Vienna from Brussels, and had the palace extended to hold them all.\n\nIn 1776 the collection was expanded when the Austrian ambassador in Venice, Giacomo Durazzo, gave around 1000 artworks to Duke Albert, so that they would have a safe home. The Albertina, as the collection and palace became known, survived even the collapse of Hapsburg power in 1918 at the end of the Great War, and the bombing of Vienna in the Second World War. It remains one of Europe’s great art museums.</long_description>

<short_description>This magnificent palace is a suitably grand and imposing surroundings for the business of running an Empire.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Hofburg was the imperial residence of the Hapsburgs in Vienna, with sections dating back to the Middle Ages. The idea of this being a single palace is something of a mistake, as it is a complex of buildings that has grown up over the centuries as the needs (not to mention rivalries and dislikes) of the Hapsburg rulers have changed. It housed chapels, a music school, and numerous smaller residences for cadet branches of the family. Indeed, there is a complete second palace in the Imperial Stables, a result of a falling out between the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and his son, the Crown Prince Maximilian. Relations between the two were so bad that the Emperor did not want his son under the same roof!\n\nOver the centuries the Hofburg has been extensively rebuilt and remodelled as funds have been available and tastes have changed. It remains, however, a serious expression of Imperial power and grandeur. The building is still in use today as the official residence of the Austrian president.</long_description>

<short_description>The British Museum is a collection of curiosities, antiquities and books that is the envy of the civilized world.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMany 18th Century gentleman collectors exhibited a “cabinet of curiosities” to friends and rivals. Competition for the most noteworthy and prestigious items soon meant that “cabinets” were often whole rooms or suites set aside for this expensive hobby. Studying the curiosities themselves also became a respectable field of scholarly endeavour by antiquarians, a strange collection themselves of dusty, rum coves with limited social skills.\n\nThe British Museum began as one of these collections, but George II donated the Old Royal Library, thus guaranteeing that every book ever published in Britain would end up on its library shelves. Further equally generous gifts, such as Garrick’s library of plays, and shrewd purchases made sure that the collection of antiquities grew at a prodigious rate. Sir William Hamilton (the husband of Emma Hamilton, the mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson) profited quite handsomely when he sold his collection of Roman and Greek items to the Museum. He had collected them, as a hobby, for next to nothing while the ambassador in Naples, Italy. It probably took his mind off being cuckolded.\n\nThe Museum also became home to spoils of exploration and conquest: objects collected during Captain Cook’s expedition to the South Seas were exhibited at the museum for a time. The Rosetta stone also ended up in the Museum, having been captured from the French after Napoleon’s abortive attempt to conquer Egypt.</long_description>

<key>prest_britain_somerset_house</key>
<short_description>This is a national government building, purpose-built to house many of the important departments of state in a suitably awe-inspiring style.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBuilt on the Strand, Somerset House was in a neo-classical style, and was not unusual in having its own water gates and docks in the basement. Eighteenth Century roads were fairly appalling, so the River Thames was the main highway through London and well frequented by government officials. The Thames was also the main sewer for London, which may have made it difficult for casual onlookers to distinguish between politicians and lumps of dung.\n\nWhen Somerset House was designed, it was intended to be a home for most of the government, at least according to the Act of Parliament in 1775 that enabled the work. Among other departments, space was to be available for the Salt Office, the Stamp Office, the Tax Office, the Navy Office (later the Admiralty), the Navy Victualling Office, the Publick Lottery Office, the Hawkers and Pedlar Office, the Hackney Coach Office, the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, the Auditors of the Imprest Office, the Pipe Office, the Offices of the Duchies of Lancaster and of Cornwall, the Office of the Ordinance, the Bargemaster’s House, and the King’s Barge Houses. Over the next decades, additional building work allowed the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquities to find rooms, not to mention the University of London as some government tenants either moved out or were closed down.</long_description>

<short_description>This is a magnificent and imposing monument to French military prowess and success.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAll armies and nations need to mark their victories and honour their dead. The Arc de Triomphe was the largest structure of its type ever designed, and was intended to be a grandiloquent gesture of French military superiority. This, given that Napoleon Bonaparte had direction of the French army, was entirely reasonable.\n\nCreated to mark Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz in 1805, the structure was commissioned a year later, but not completed until the 1830s. Napoleon ordered a wooden mock-up to be put in place in 1810, and work was completely halted after the Bourbon restoration. Napoleon’s corpse eventually passed through the arch on its way to its final resting place at Les Invalides. This was not the only remarkable thing to pass through the arch: at the victory parade to mark the end of the First World War, a pilot flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch as part of the event! The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a later addition, commemorating the honoured dead and missing of the French army in the Great War.</long_description>

<short_description>Governments need a suitably magnificent setting to conduct their business.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLawmakers should meet in awe-inspiring and magnificent buildings, because then there is a chance that they will take the business of making new law seriously. If something cannot be built for the purpose, then taking the extremely expensive home of a “dashed aristo” will do quite nicely!\n\nHistorically, the Palais Bourbon was built as a home for Louise-Françoise, duchesse de Bourbon, one Louis XIV’s legitimised bastards by one of his favourite mistresses, Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. The building, although rather magnificent and scarcely a hovel, was not technically a palace, because Louise-Françoise herself did not have royal rank. After the French Revolution, it was nationalised and used as a meeting place of the Council of Five Hundred. It is still a parliament building, now acting as home to the deputies of the French National Assembly, the lower legislative house of the French Republic. Louise-Françoise probably wouldn’t recognise her old home, as it has been extensively remodelled.</long_description>

<short_description>From its location near the city of Satara this great fortress dominates the surrounding area.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is located on top of an imposing mountain, making any attempt to take it difficult indeed. Even a long siege would be a difficult proposition, as the fort is well supplied with water. The fort itself controls the surrounding countryside completely: no foe can move in southern Maharashtra without being observed.\n\nThe fort was taken by Shrimant Shahu Sambhaji Raje Bhonsle Chhatrapati Maharaj (1682-1749), the fourth ruler of the Maratha Empire. Shahu Chhatrapati was a survivor, of both Mughal captivity and a Maratha civil war. He was freed at the end of the War of 27 years (1681-1707) and managed to bring stability and careful expansion to the Marathas. Given that he had spent most of his childhood as an honoured prisoner of the Mughals, his efforts are creditable indeed.</long_description>

<key>prest_maratha_shaniwarwada</key>
<short_description>This magnificent fortified palace is a visible expression of Maratha greatness.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe palace name reflects the auspicious day Shaniwar (Saturday), 10 January 1730 when the foundation stones were placed by the prime minister, Baji Rao, of the Maratha Empire. This wada (or residential complex) was never intended for the king, but to be an official residence for prime ministers and his administration of the Maratha Empire. No expense was spared in its construction: every door in the building was hand-carved from the finest teak; every floor was the finest marble available. The palace took two years to complete, and later prime ministers made it grander still, adding bastions, and magnificent gardens.\n\nWhen designed, the Shaniwar Wada was as much a fortress as palace. An army attempting to breach its gates faced formidable defences.\n\nThe building still exists, although it is much reduced from its former grandeur. A fire in 1828 destroyed much of the original, leaving only the granite structures undamaged.</long_description>

<key>prest_ottomans_naval_engineering_school</key>
<short_description>Despite the name, this naval college offers training to naval architects, shipbuilders and quarterdeck officers.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Naval Engineers’ School began as a training school at the Golden Horn shipyards, and was put on a formal footing by Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha (1713-90), the Grand Vizier of Sultan Mustafa III, and a Franco-Hungarian military adviser, François Baron de Tott. It was a part of Mustafa’s efforts to modernise the Turkish military and naval system in the face of considerable resistance from the janissaries and their leadership. The teaching given was extremely good, and produced fine officers.\n\nHasan Pasha is actually almost more interesting than the school, as he started life as a slave in eastern Turkey and rose through the ranks of the military. He even spent time with the Barbary Pirates of Algiers and, while there, domesticated a lion as a pet! Despite being on the losing side at Battle of Chesma in 1770 his ship, the 84-gun Real Mustafa, was one of the few on the Turkish side to emerge with any credit. His record certainly helped when it came to driving through the (limited) reforms that Mustafa managed to achieve. Baron de Tott’s other achievement was the establishment of a new cannon foundry.</long_description>

<key>prest_ottomans_nur-u_osmaniye_mosque</key>
<short_description>This magnificent Baroque and Rococo mosque is one of the finest religious buildings ever constructed. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is designed in a style that was extremely popular in the Ottoman Empire of the 1700s, and was ordered by Sultan Mahmud I in 1748. Unfortunately for him, it was only completed in the reign of Sultan Osman III in 1755, and is probably the most significant achievement of that particular sultan. The name of the mosque, “Light of Osman” commemorates his efforts in financing this superb, light, airy building with its many windows.\n\nBy most standards (even those of an 18th Century absolute monarch) Osman was a little odd. He was notably intolerant towards non-Muslims and generally regarded as a bit insignificant before he took the throne. He had lived much of his life within the palace as a prisoner. He loathed music, and banished every musician from his court. He also found the company of women extremely distasteful, having been imprisoned within the harem section of the palace. When he became Sultan he took to wearing iron shoes so that his approach would always be audible. Any women in the vicinity were expected to hear him coming, and then find somewhere to hide while he passed by. He was succeeded by Mustafa III, a better fellow and ruler by far.</long_description>

<key>prest_poland_akademia</key>
<short_description>This cadet school produces fine officers for the Polish army.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nHistorically, the Akademia, or Szkoła Rycerska, was the Knights’ School or the Nobles’ Academy of Cadets. It was the first state school in Poland, established by King Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the last elected monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1765. King Stanislaw had an abiding belief in the worth of education, both to the individual and the state. Surrounded by enemies, he did his best to advance Polish interests.\n\nOne of the more interesting officer cadets was Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746-1817). Benjamin Franklin recruited him to serve in the Continental Army, and he was appointed as head (military) engineer. His contributions at Ticonderoga and Saratoga, among other occasions, eventually lead to his promotion to brigadier general. He was also given citizenship, land and a large cash grant. To his eternal credit, he used his reward money to help black slaves achieve their freedom. Not satisfied with that, he returned home to Poland and organised a rising against the occupying Russians, although this ended in failure. Tsar Paul I, however, obviously thought him important and influential: in return for an oath of loyalty, 20,000 Polish prisoners of war were freed. Before his death in exile in 1815, Kościuszko had also freed all his serfs in Poland.</long_description>

<key>prest_poland_lazienki_park</key>
<short_description>These magnificent gardens are a splendid setting for any royal palace.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Park and its gardens were acquired by Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, after his election. Although already impressive, he set about remodelling them, and made the gardens his life’s work, building his “Palace on the Water” in a suitably magnificent setting by the Lake. This watery connection was how the park got its name of Lazienki or “Royal Baths” Park, after the bathing pavilion that was constructed in the gardens.\n\nThe garden was also a magnificent setting for Stanislaw’s regular dinner parties with leading artists, writers and politicians. While Stanislaw was something of an autocrat, he was also a believer in education and the ideas of the Enlightenment, using the dinners to engage with leading thinkers.\n\nThe park and palaces were lucky to survive the Warsaw Rising in 1944. They were mined for destruction, but the German occupiers never completed their demolition works, although the Lazienki Palace was burned.</long_description>

<short_description>The academy is a gathering of the finest scientific and cultural minds in Germany, uniting science and the humanities in one organisation.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile the Academy was a pet project of Prince Frederick III, the Elector of Brandenburg, he did not fund it from royal or state treasuries. Instead, he rather cleverly granted the academy a monopoly on producing and selling calendars in his domain, giving it a steady, but not substantial, income. When Frederick was crowned as “King in Prussia”, the Academy was granted royal patronage.\n\nUnder Frederick the Great, a man normally regarded as a warrior-king, the academy merged with Prussian Nouvelle Société Littéraire (French being a primary language of literature and culture in the 18th Century) and the Royal Academy of Sciences. He also offered cash prizes as incentives to the members to investigate and solve the scientific conundrums of the day. The Academy had its own laboratories, an observatory, libraries, an operating theatre (for public demonstrations of surgery), and gardens for plant specimens.</long_description>

<key>prest_prussia_brandenburg_gate</key>
<short_description>This is a magnificent monument to Prussian military prowess and the peace it obtained.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSited on one of the original city gates of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate stands at the end of the Unter den Linden, the original approach to the city palace of Frederick II, the King of Prussia. The monumental entrance was always intended to overawe and dwarf anyone going to the palace, making clear Prussian greatness before they had even begun their audience with the monarch.\n\nThe choice of a Classical style was quite deliberate, as it was intended to echo the achievements of Rome and Greece. The decoration of a Quadriga of Victory, or four-horse chariot, is also intended to evoke ancient connotations of triumph, specifically the quadriga from the Hippodrome of Constantinople. It was definitely a symbol of peace through strength, which is almost certainly one of the reasons that it was looted and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1806 after his victory at Jena-Auerstedt. The quadriga was returned in 1814, when Napoleon went into exile on Elba, and given the Iron Cross symbol that it currently carries. Subsequently, the Brandenburg Gate managed to survive two World Wars and the Cold War in a relatively undamaged state.</long_description>

<key>prest_russia_kunstkamara</key>
<short_description>This huge collection of natural curiosities and rarities is intended to educate and inform.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe museum was the idea of Peter the Great, and was built facing his magnificent Winter Palace in the purpose-built “window on the west” of St. Petersburg. The collection has a morbid, even prurient air to it, as it features a huge number of “natural curiosities” in the form of human and animal foetuses and still-births, all carefully preserved so that their details can be studied. The point, however, wasn’t simply to collect odd items for the sake of collecting oddities. Peter the Great wished to debunk the superstitions and fears of Russia which, even though he was the tsar, he regarded as backwards and ignorant.\n\nHe had little interest in collecting man-made objects, unlike the hunters and collectors of antiquities at other great museums of the time. Major collections of minerals, rocks and scientific instruments were added to the Kunstkamera (a word derived from Dutch). The museum survived as a single collection for around a century, then its collections were despatched to a variety of Imperial museums.</long_description>

<key>prest_russia_winter_palace</key>
<short_description>Peter the Great’s splendid building was intended to rival any royal palace anywhere in Europe or beyond.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt did so magnificently. The location in St. Petersburg was part of Peter’s policy of opening up to western ideas, where they were suitable for Russia, and his adoption of western architecture, culture and technology. The Tsar wanted his Palace to be the centrepiece of a “Third Rome” on the River Neva, and a new Imperial seat of government for all the Russias. It was deliberately built to be a palace rather than a fortress like the Kremlin in Moscow, although the wide prospects and avenues of St. Petersburg certainly made it entirely defensible by musket-armed troops.\n\nThe Palace remained as the official home of the Tsars for the next two centuries. It continued to play an important part in Imperial affairs until the end of Tsarist Russia and beyond. The 1905 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of unarmed protestors publicly demonstrated that the Tsar, for all the propaganda about being the “Little Father” of his people, had scant regard for the needs of ordinary folk. The storming of the Winter Palace in 1917 is an iconic moment in Russian history, the defining moment in the establishment of the Soviet state.</long_description>

<short_description>The fine arts are an ornament to any civilized nation. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Academy received royal approval in 1744, but it was not until the reign of Carlos III that it found a proper home in a former Baroque palace. This is somewhat surprising given that Carlos was a benevolent despot and rather fond of hunting. He was, however, also much given to public works and, more significantly for the advancement of the arts, had had a serious falling out with the anti-Enlightenment Jesuits. He suppressed the order in Spain and rendered the Spanish Inquisition largely ineffective.\n\nThe Academy included many artists of note, but surely its most distinguished master was Francisco Goya (1746-1828). Goya was supremely talented, and became the painter of choice in the Spanish court. His work marks a transition between the work of the “Old Masters” and the modern world to come: his painting “La maja desnuda” has been described as the first non-symbolic nude painting in the Western world. Sadly, he was tortured by deafness and illness in later life, and his painting took on a grimmer, darker feel.\n\nThe Academy is now home to a fine collection of paintings from the 15th Century onwards.</long_description>

<short_description>The Royal Palace is a suitable setting for any monarch with pretensions to rule much of the world.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOriginally a Moorish fortress when Madrid was ruled by the Islamic emir of Cordoba, and then a castle under the stewardship of the Christian kings of Castile, the site was not regularly used as a royal residence. The Antiguo Alcázar or Old Castle dated back to the 16th Century, but this burned down on Christmas Eve, 1734.\n\nKing Philip V, the first of the Bourbon rulers of Spain, ordered a new palace to be constructed. Perhaps he had it in mind to create a rival to Versailles, the palace of his grandfather, Louis XIV of France. In the event, he died before the construction work was complete and never lived in the New Palace, as it was only in 1764 that Carlos III occupied the building. As a setting for a monarchy, however, the palace had been well worth waiting for! It is vast: with 2800 rooms it is far bigger than any other European palace. \n\nIt is still the official residence of the Spanish monarchy, although it is only used for state occasions.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive collection of art would be an ornament to any nation.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Royal Museum was founded in 1792 by King Gustav III, and gave a home to his exquisite artwork collection. It now forms the core of the Swedish Nationalmuseum. \n\nGustav was an absolutist, as might be expected of a nephew of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He objected to parliamentary reforms, sought to distract everyone’s attention with an unsuccessful war against Russia and ignored public opinion. Although he was a playwright and a patron of music, the arts and sciences, and spent liberally on all of them, he did so without gaining much popularity among the people or nobles. His museum was the result of his free spending ways: where art was concerned, he was rather liberal with his money.\n\nIn the end, Gustav was assassinated by a conspiracy of noblemen at the Royal Opera House, an event that itself was turned into an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, Un ballo in maschera (The Masked Ball). Verdi had to change many of the details due to government censorship, as the assassination of a monarch was felt to be a bit too controversial in Italy of the 1850s.</long_description>

<short_description>The Royal Palace in Stockholm is a suitably grand setting for a monarchy with pretensions to rule the Baltic and northern Europe.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBuilt on the site of an older fortress called the Three Crowns, the current Palace is actually its second incarnation as the first building was destroyed in fire in 1697. The current version was designed by Count Nicodemus Tessin (the Younger), an able Baroque architect and city planner, and took the best part of 50 years to complete in brick and sandstone. Much of the surrounding city was also re-laid as moats and the like were filled in.\n\nThe Palace is still in use as the official residence of the Swedish monarchy, and houses significant museum collections, including the Livrustkammaren, or Royal Armoury within its 609 rooms. This is the oldest museum in Sweden, established by the great Gustavus Adolphus in 1628 when he decided to keep and display his equipment from his Polish campaigns. The various departments of the royal court and household are also still based in the palace, as are the Högvakten, the Royal Guard of the Svea Livgarde (Lifeguards), who have been a part of Palace life since the 1750s.</long_description>

<short_description>This naval school produces fine naval officers for Dutch sea service.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Dutch Navy owes its existence to the arming of Dutch trading ships in the 16th Century and earlier, often in direct contravention of orders from their Spanish overlords. The independently-minded Dutch were not minded to take much notice of such instructions. A centralised navy, dedicated solely to warfare, could trace its origins back to 1488, and had managed to dominate the seas for much of that time.\n\nA formal training system for officers, however, had to wait until 1785 when this land-based training establishment was opened. Before that, officers had learned their trade at sea, in a very practical way. The whole business was formalised under the short-live Republic of Batavia (1795-1806), although by this time maritime supremacy had passed to the British Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart was one of the most prestigious naval schools, and produced fine officers.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nPieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778) left his fortune to the furthering of science and culture, as befitted a part-Scottish follower of the Scottish Enlightenment. He also left money for some almshouses for the poor folk of Haarlem. Before his death he had established various learned societies in the town and, like many gentlemen of the period, had a “cabinet of curiosities”: a large collection of objects of interest or antiquarian value. His fortune, made from the cloth trade, was certainly large enough to let him indulge in his passions for science and collecting.\n\nThe museum was a reflection of his interests, and was added to over the years so that it now has a fine collection of fossils, scientific instruments (and making them was something of a Dutch speciality), coins, paintings, prints and drawings. Pieter Teyler left a charitable and worthy legacy of a “Christian gentleman” in the museum and the almshouses.</long_description>

<short_description>Every new nation needs a birthplace.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\n Independence Hall in Philadelphia was actually built by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature as their State House, and so for the first two decades after completion it was home to part of the British administration in America. It is a practical, red brick building in a grand colonial style and has an architectural honesty and pleasing, human proportion to it that is sometimes lacking in grander neo-Classical structures.\n\nFrom 1775, the building was the home to the Second Continental Congress, the representatives of the Thirteen Colonies who approved the Declaration of Independence. The romantic view is that the “Liberty Bell” was rung to bring citizens to hear the reading of the Declaration in July 1776. Unfortunately, for romantics, historians now believe that the steeple of Independence Hall was in too bad a state to allow the ringing of any bells from the Hall. That hasn’t stopped the romantics believing the story for a minute! Independence Hall was abandoned by Congress when the British occupied Philadelphia from 1777-78. The government eventually moved to a specially created federal district (later to become Washington DC) when a mutiny by the Continental Army drove them out of Philadelphia in 1783. But for the actions of the mutineers, Philadelphia would probably still be the capital of the United States.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe Smithsonian is not like other major museums, established to show off the collections of wealthy patrons or as an exercise in national glory. Instead, it is the legacy of a man who was neither an American nor visited the country. James Smithson (1765–1829) stipulated that his fortune was to be used for the “increase &amp; diffusion of Knowledge among men” if his nephew died without leaving an heir. With over pre-inflationary $500,000 in the fund, it took Congress nearly a decade to decide how to spend the money and the Smithsonian “Castle” in Washington was only completed in 1855.\n\nSince then, the Smithsonian has become one of the world’s leading repositories for historical objects and archives, funded by the US government and private donations. It now has 20 different branches, specialising in everything from ethnic art and objects to aerospace exhibits, and helping to manage the Smithsonian is one of the (very few) official duties of the Vice President of the United States.</long_description>

<short_description>A port will improve a region’s wealth and open up trade routes.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMost roads are simply terrible, and bulky cargoes must go by ship: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. Trading ports improve a country&apos;s export capacity and increase trade value. They also make the whole world a marketplace, by allowing sea trade routes to be established.\n\nSometimes, the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent: British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no market for it! Coastal trade was also an easy way to turn a profit in Britain, the leading trade nation. A “cheese fleet” did nothing but sail back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided the preservative needed for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London. Although salty, this was undoubtedly healthier than most food on a gentleman’s table!</long_description>

<short_description>This port significantly improves your export capacity and increases trade value.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA commercial basin opens up new opportunities for trade, as agents now put together cargoes and charter vessels for merchants who would otherwise be unable to trade. This significantly improves not only the town’s wealth, but the entire region&apos;s and opens up a number of new sea trade routes that had previously been inaccessible. This commercial advance does have one disadvantage however, the lower classes resent their harsh working conditions and their happiness is affected.\n\nThe infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool, in England, and Africa was a staggeringly profitable business. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in horrendous conditions, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean and America, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum bound for Britain. There was a handsome profit in each stage. The moral foulness of the trade, however, eventually trumped its profitability and, in 1807, the abolitionists finally succeeded in having the slave trade banned throughout the British Empire. Existing slaves, however, were not freed in British territories until 1833.</long_description>

<short_description>A massive enterprise monopolising part of a nation’s trade will improve both region and town wealth.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrading companies can be enormous, with fleets of armed merchant ships carrying all manner of cargoes. An enterprise of this size greatly improves export capacity and increases trade value; it also improves the wealth of town and region each turn. The improved ship building capacity provided by this port also increases the number of sea trade routes that can be utilised. Unfortunately, the happiness of the lower classes is greatly affected by their unpleasant working conditions in the company enterprises.\n\nHistorically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions. In modern times only petrochemical, mining and arms companies have commanded comparable power over developing nations.</long_description>

<short_description>Tenant farmers add to the agricultural wealth of a region and improve military replenishment.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, but successful tenants who develop the land can become quietly wealthy men. They may be able to buy their farms.\n\nHistorically, tenanted farms made a good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Crops failed with terrible regularity, forcing up food prices and causing social unrest.\n\nTenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus. For a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms was the income. Landlords could live the high life in a city and rarely needed to trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside, at least as long as they had trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arose, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers. As a class, landowners suffered terribly in the French Revolution as the peasants who actually did all the work took bloody revenge for years of ill treatment.</long_description>

<short_description>Displacing people in favour of an animal cash crop improves the agricultural wealth of a region and improves replenishment rates.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Clearances add to the agricultural wealth of a region, as demand for meat and wool increases rapidly. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting.\n\nThe “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Despite popular legend, it was Highland clan leaders who carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clansmen into exile. The chieftains wanted to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did.</long_description>

<short_description>These estates add substantially to the agricultural wealth and the replenishment rate of a region.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLarge estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-sized grand houses built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but also idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes, and to the misery of the lower classes who are forced leave their homes to make way for deer parks and Classical follies.\n\nHistorically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today as tourist attractions.</long_description>

<short_description>Gold mining adds greatly to the wealth of a region, but at a cost in lives and injuries.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nNo one, however, cares about those, as the greed of men for gold seems to know no limits; even townsfolk uninvolved in the mine feel the benefit of the wealth produced. It is a dirty, dangerous business and the miners risk everything for the sake of the owner’s profits.\n\nHistorically, profits for owners were the only consideration in mines. Accidents were seen as inevitable and annoying, because they slowed down extraction. Miners were expected to work in terrible conditions, and paid piece rates for their work. Because safety work and shoring up tunnels did not earn money, the tasks were skipped. What point is there in working if you are not going to be paid? Pit props may stop tunnels collapsing, but putting them in is not paid work, and the miners may even be charged for the materials! Owners were quite willing to charge them for candles, tools and gunpowder. They were also willing to pay lower rates to women and child labourers too: women often pull carts to the surface and children need less space and air than adults.</long_description>

<short_description>Deep mines flood, and the water must be pumped clear if profits are to be made. Deeper down, there are riches to be found.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water in a short time to keep a mine open, and make it sensible to dig deep shafts. Older workings can be kept going even after shallow gold deposits have been plundered. Who is to say how much more money can be made, deep beneath the ground? A steam-pumped gold mine makes an impressive contribution to the mining wealth of its region, and improves the town wealth too. However, even by the standards of the time, conditions for the workers are unpleasant and this makes the lower classes unhappy.\n\nBy the time of the Napoleonic Wars, beam engines were over 80 years old, and the engineering behind them was well understood. Cornishman Thomas Newcomen’s original “atmospheric” engine, first used in tin mines, had been made obsolete by newer condensing steam engines. Designs pioneered by James Watt, efficient as they were, did not always persuade mine owners to spend money on replacing old machinery when it was still profitable!</long_description>

<short_description>Mining is only the first stage of gaining wealth. Every last lump of ore must be processed in search of elusive golden wealth!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOnce gold-bearing rock has been dug up, the real work can start: processing and smelting everything that comes up to extract every last troy ounce of gold. Entire hillsides can be ripped apart by men’s labour, and then more men hunt work night and day around hellish furnaces. The result is that this mine is a massive addition to the wealth of the region and surrounding towns. The process, however, involves a great deal of work in very unpleasant circumstances, and the lower classes in the whole region are made unhappy by this building.\n\nA mine owner, on the other hand, can be enriched beyond the dreams of Croesus, despite the cost in human terms. In addition to deaths in the mines, there are deaths in the processing sheds too: dust is ever present, and the fumes from smelting works are often poisonous. A large mine can poisons land and water for miles around, and turn pleasant countryside into a wasteland of spoil heaps and toxic ponds. This does not matter, as long as profit continues.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA cavalryman is only as good as his horse, so the care of these animals should be first and foremost in his mind. Stables add to the agricultural wealth of a region, although producing draft animals is not their primary purpose.\n\nHistorically, the national stud farms of France were closed during the Revolution because they were seen as a symbol of the decadent aristocracy. When Napoleon came to power he re-opened them and proceeded to recreate France’s breeding stock, taking stallions from conquered enemies. He kept a personal stable of about eighty horses, most of which were good-tempered and gentle gallopers. Growing up in Corsica, Napoleon never received any formal training in the equestrian arts and many reported that his riding style was practical, but lacking in refinement. It is also worth noting that a general has better things to do in battle than worry about controlling his horse.</long_description>

<short_description>Horse breeding improves the quality of mounts for cavalry recruits, aiding the recruitment of new cavalry units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAdvances in animal husbandry allow horse breeders to become more selective about the traits they wish to cultivate, thus improving the military worth of their horses. With better breeding schemes the recruitment of cavalry units becomes significantly cheaper, as less effort has to be expended in finding good quality mounts. A stud farm also adds significantly to the agricultural wealth of a region.\n\nHistorically, the Tarbes Stud Farm near Lourdes in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France was one of the most famous of the Napoleonic era. Established in 1806, it was created to provide hussar regiments with horses. It took pure-bred horses from many sources, including the pure-blooded English, pure-blooded Arab, as favoured by Napoleon himself, along with French saddle, Merens, and Clydesdales from Brittany and Franche-Comté. The Anglo-Arab cross was first produced at Tarbes. The stud farm remains open to this day.</long_description>

Its main purpose is to provide mounts for cavalry regiments, thus allowing new units to be raised. As well as improving the cavalry regiments of an army, an equestrian estate will add substantially to the agricultural wealth of a region.\n\nHistorically, Napoleon favoured white or grey Arabian horses over the more traditional thoroughbreds. These animals were put through an incredibly rigorous training regime before they were ridden by Napoleon. Trained by his riding master, they were subjected to gunfire, swords and flags being waved in front of them, drums, trumpets and other instruments being played without warning, and they even had animals driven between their legs. These horses had to be ready for any eventuality on and off the battlefield. Napoleon enjoyed riding for pleasure and was almost killed when a horse bolted and threw him against a tree.</long_description>

<short_description>An iron mine makes the recruitment of land units cheaper, and adds to a region&apos;s mining wealth.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLit only by candles or lamps, most miners work in hellish conditions. In some mines firedamp, or methane, produces a constant risk of explosion thanks to the naked lights. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any blast.\n\n Historically, mining accidents were very common. Miners were paid only for the valuable minerals that they extracted, so there was little incentive to carry out safety work. Pit props will prevent a roof from collapsing, but putting them in did not earn any payment. Indeed, mine owners were known to charge for the wood needed to make them. It was not just men who laboured below the ground. Women often pulled carts from the work face to the surface. Children needed less space and air than adults, which made them ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and taking food and water to the miners.</long_description>

<short_description>Being able to pump water out of a mine increases productivity and therefore the wealth it produces.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs soon as a mine shaft drops below the water table, flooding is a constant danger to life and profits. Pumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A stationary steam beam engine can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. The greater availability of iron also makes the recruitment of all land units significantly cheaper. However these new inventions are not welcome among the lower classes. They quite rightly fear being replaced with machines, and are unhappy as a result.\n\nHistorically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had some problems and was inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was easy to obtain. James Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient, and it formed the basis of all steam engines built afterwards. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner: Matthew Boulton proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist. Boulton even persuaded the British Parliament to extend the steam engine patent, guaranteeing the pair further profit!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nMining is only part of the process of extracting wealth from the ground. On the surface the ore must be processed and smelted. Because iron production is easier, a mining complex also makes the recruitment of all land units a good deal cheaper.\n\nFor a mine owner to make as much money as possible from his investment, the ore has to have every scrap of usable metal taken out of it. This meant that a large number of processes had to be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore had to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, then crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks required a large number of workers, and women and children did some of the lighter work while their men laboured in the mine. Even away from the shafts, the work was dangerous and deaths and injuries were not uncommon. It was unhealthy work too: dust was ever-present and the fumes from smelting works were often poisonous. Pouring molten metal with little care for safety killed men in all kinds of horrible ways.</long_description>

<short_description>These are roads where a considered effort has been made to improve the surface, and provide proper drainage for rainwater.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nConstructing roads allows local goods to reach nearby markets, and gives some useful work to paupers and work-shy individuals who would otherwise be moved on or require expensive charity. At the very least, the larger rocks have been moved out of the road, pounded to pieces and the resulting rubble used as a roadbed. Drainage ditches mean the road ceases to be a convenient gutter for rainwater, and a muddy hell for anyone trying to use it.\n\nHistorically, there was often a military imperative for building roads. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid reaction. In Scotland, General Wade completed a network of roads to “Roman” standards during the 1720s so that armies could quickly move into the rebellious Highlands – the Jacobite supporters of the ousted Stuart dynasty were a constant threat. His achievement was celebrated in a (now defunct) verse of the then-new British anthem:\n\nLord, grant that Marshal Wade\nMay, by thy mighty aid,\nVictory bring.\nMay he sedition hush\nAnd, like a torrent, rush\nRebellious Scots to crush.\nGod save the King.</long_description>

The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not entirely comfortable for carts, carriages or foot traffic: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!\n\nHistorically, the expense of cobbles, and the fine-looking result of cobbling a street, meant that they were often only used in or near towns or for high-status routes where the great and the good could not be expected to wallow in the mud like poor people. Cobbles, however, did serve the poor in another way: they were the perfect size for rioters! Levered out of place, they were the ideal thrown weapon (along with the half-house brick or “brickbat”) for a bit of informal remonstrating with any nearby unwelcome representatives of law and order.</long_description>

<key>roads_dust_tracks</key>
<short_description>These roads are the most basic of routes, linking villages and towns in a meandering fashion.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs a means of travel, the main benefit of a track is that it leads somewhere, probably – without local knowledge, it can be difficult to tell! Without signposts or markers, there is little to distinguish one path from another. Even local knowledge of a route can be limited, because locals rarely travel further than the nearest market town and possibly not even that far. The actual going is a little better than across open ground because at least large rocks and bushes have been removed. In wet weather, however, it may be considerably worse as the track turns to a muddy streambed.\n\nHistorically, these roads were often little more than drover’s tracks or country lanes that have been worn into the landscape by centuries of use. While perfectly adequate to local needs, they were not suitable for military purposes: heavy cannons in particular require solid going if they are to be moved at more than a snail’s pace, or at all!</long_description>

<key>roads_metalled</key>
<short_description>A metalled road is surfaced with small broken stones, providing a good, strong and long-lasting route for military and civilian traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe road is actually constructed in layers of increasingly large stones (going down through a cross-section), with each layer being compressed by rolling. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to private users of such excellent roads and turnpikes.\n\nHistorically, “metalled roads” were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), although “tarmac” itself was not called that until 1901!\n\nRoad building produced some other interesting characters, such as Blind Jack of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. Although completely sightless thanks to childhood smallpox, John “Jack” Metcalf (1717-1810) was, at various times, a fiddle player, an army recruiter, and a haulier. When a turnpike was built near his birthplace he used his local experience to create a masterpiece of a road, including a section on a raft of logs across a bog. His blindness was no handicap in bringing road projects in on time and to cost, although he was always at a loss to explain to others how he managed his finances so well.</long_description>

<short_description>A metalled road is surfaced with small broken stones, packed together to make a weatherproof route for military and civilian traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe small stones form only the top layer: beneath are further layers of compacted stones and rubble, each compressed by both design and continuing traffic. The roadbed itself drains well, and can support large volumes of traffic and individually heavy items such as cannons.\n\nHistorically, the most famous and effective land route in world was probably the collection of toll roads and turnpikes known as the “Grand Trunk” in India. Much of it was little more than compacted dirt (mud in the rainy season) but large parts were well constructed. Trade, the lifeblood of the continent, and many armies, passed up and down the Grand Trunk over the centuries, from the wilds of the mountainous borders with Afghanistan to the rich provinces of the South. The Grand Trunk was also the murderous hunting ground of members of the Thuggee cult. These followers of the Hindu goddess Kali would befriend unsuspecting travellers, put them at their ease and then murder and rob them as an act of sacrament. Oddly, not all Thugs were Hindu; Muslims and Sikhs were found in their ranks, probably for the loot.</long_description>

<short_description>An academy is a “gentleman’s club”, of sorts, for the greatest minds of a nation to gather for discourse, lectures, debates and some very nice dinners. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAcademies concern themselves with all aspects of national cultural and scientific life. From the most abstract of mathematical conundrums to the collections of natural wonders and the study of languages and lexicography, nothing is outside the interests of academicians. The members are, by and large, selected by their peers, although individual governments do use their influence to secure places for worthy men – and these learned societies are not above granting membership to royalty in the hope of securing patronage!\n\nLarge projects were matters of national prestige. The Académie Française, was charged with the collation of an official French dictionary. The epic voyage of Captain Cook, RN, in 1768–71 was partly influenced by the desire of the British Royal Society to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun from Tahiti. Other nations sent observers to, among other places, Canada and Siberia – Cook got the nicest destination! By observing the event from different sides of the Earth, parallax made it possible to calculate the size of the solar system and establish the astronomical unit.</long_description>

<short_description>An observatory is a centre for many scientific studies, not just astronomy. All the physical sciences are advanced here. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe study of the heavens leads to advances in mathematics, and improvements in scientific instrument making, horology and, perhaps most importantly of all, navigation and surveying. Accurate star charts and lunar tables (showing the phases of the moon) enable sailors to determine their position at sea, and a navy that can navigate accurately is one that can carry out its duties effectively. An observatory is also a centre for national prestige, as discoveries made and published reflect well on the institute and the nation that funds its work.\n\nHistorically, observatories were vital in the development of navigation and accurate clocks. This is why the zero-degree longitude line passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London (until 1884 most states used their own nationalistic reference points). Indeed, the nationalism of astronomy often leads to ignorance of the observations and deductions of non-European astronomers.\n\nAstronomers could also be outrageous flatterers. After he discovered what he thought was a new planet, Sir William Herschel chose the name “Georgium Sidus”, or George’s Star, in a transparent bit of sucking up to his patron, King George III. Other astronomers flirted with the name “Herschel” then settled on “Uranus” for the new planet.</long_description>

<key>rTimber1_timber_logging_camp_european</key>
<short_description>Forests are a vital strategic, as well as economic resource and make construction and ship building cheaper.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBuildings require large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding. Logging camps reduces the cost of other construction work, as timbers are cut and prepared centrally with great precision and speed. This building also makes an important contribution to the industrial wealth of the region.\n\nApart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is also vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons and many kinds of good quality timber each; building a logging camp should make the construction of all ships marginally cheaper.\n\nHistorically, the forests around the Baltic were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! This need meant that the British interfered, almost constantly, in Baltic affairs. Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty.</long_description>

<short_description>Prepared timber makes construction and shipbuilding significantly cheaper.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA water-powered lumber mill produces logs and sawn timber from nearby forests. Its semi-finished products increase the industrial wealth of a region because it is more profitable to ship half-finished planks than tree trunks.\n\nIt has always been possible for logging to denude a forest of all of its profitable trees, in the process causing terrible damage to the land. Without the trees the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of trees to re-establish themselves. This worried hardly anyone at the end of the 18th Century, although there were honourable exceptions: some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies. The world had been given to men by God for them to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley, and the next.</long_description>

<short_description>This building gives a huge reduction in the costs of construction and shipbuilding.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe advent of steam power means that sawmills are no longer tied to watercourses for their power and they can be built anywhere, thus improving productivity. A sawmill also makes a considerable contribution to the industrial wealth of a region. However, working conditions are not very good, and the lower classes are unhappy as a result.\n\nThe invention of machine tools greatly improved the productivity of sawmills. The invention of the circular saw and gang saws meant that a tree could be turned into planks in one easy step. Both of these inventions were prone to breaking down: the circular saw was easily damaged by overheating or dirty logs. The expensive nature of this equipment led to the creation of a new sawmill technician known as a saw filer. These men were highly skilled in metalwork and their primary task was to keep the saws in perfect working order. High speed saws are not the safest pieces of industrial equipment to work near, and deaths and injuries were common.</long_description>

<short_description>A steady alcohol supply improves the happiness of all classes, which is hardly surprising.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA vineyard is a farm dedicated to the growing of grapes and the production of wine. Thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities, wine, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans, and one of life&apos;s little pleasures. Alcohol provides a welcome distraction from life&apos;s anxieties, for the lowliest revolutionary serf to the richest nobleman. Building a vineyard will result in a small improvement in happiness, while also slightly improving town wealth.\n\nThe patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret&quot; or Bordeaux wine, dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Napoleon’s Continental System of denying trade to English merchants also damaged the claret producing areas of France and probably helped make English drinkers very angry when they sobered up! There were many more local grape varieties under cultivation, because pests accidentally imported from America in the 19th Century wiped out older varieties. Wines would have tasted very different from each other, even within the same region than is the case today.</long_description>

<short_description>Everyone enjoys a glass of wine, regardless of class.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA winery takes the product of several vineyards and produces wine on a large scale, shipping much of it in casks to distant markets. A winery improves the happiness of all classes and increases town wealth in a region.\n\nGlass bottles are expensive, and it is better to ship wine in casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process that happens in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!\n\nThe 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common; whitening flour with chalk was a common practice. Wine was no exception, and watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without laws to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners and food merchants adding anything they wanted to everyone’s food and drink.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA wine estate represents a substantial investment in vines, land, and time. Wine is lovingly produced, carefully aged, and sold on at a premium. Hic!\n\n Wine production is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil, and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood.\n\nBy the late 18th Century, the “age of prodigious boozing” was still going strong in Europe. In England, the Prince Regent set the standards for gluttony and excess, and was widely emulated by his subjects. Georgian Englishmen had bottomless gullets, even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Despite what everyone thought at the time, drink was not the cause of gout, an agonising inflammation of the joints. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet, as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period; the liberal use of poisonous lead compounds to sweeten wine and food probably did little to help matters!</long_description>

<short_description>The taxman is, for common people, the face and grasping fist of government.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA tax office is never a welcome sight, and adds slightly to the repression of the region where it is found. It does, however, allow for more efficient tax collection and aids in the recruitment of military units. It is a necessary evil for government: no matter what the national constitution may be, or the political beliefs of the ruling classes, no government can do anything unless it has money.\n\nTaxation has always been the most resented part of government. Tax collectors often had quite draconian powers, and could call upon the services of the military to encourage the people to pay. This was often necessary, as taxes did not fall fairly on every part of the community: the poor often paid far more in relative and absolute terms, than the wealthy. The worst case was probably to be found in Spain, where the nobility, the landed gentry and the wealthy simply never bothered to pay taxes at all. The Napoleonic period also saw income tax levied for the first time in Great Britain in 1798. It was abolished in 1802, but governments tend to remember good ways of getting money out of the people!</long_description>

<short_description>There may be a monarch or president on the coinage but, for most folk, the magistrate is the man that really matters!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLaw, order, and taxes are the basis of government. A magistrate is the government embodied in one person: his duties mean that he can help collect taxes, repress the people, and take their sons into the army, all at the same time. He is an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, instigator of charitable works, military recruiter and father figure.\n\nA magistrate usually represents the state and the landed classes, even in a republic. Liberty and equality are all very well, but the rich need to be sure their wealth is secure. Under Napoleon, magistrates in every district were carefully selected and monitored by a Ministry of Justice, and used to keep an eye on disloyalty to the new regime. Often, magistrates were sent to distant provinces, so that they had no local sympathies. In Britain, the opposite tended to be the case: magistrates were selected from among the local gentry, who knew their neighbours and tenants intimately. Magistrates also had the power to call out troops to put down any civil disturbances, and to send convicted men off to the military as punishment.</long_description>

<short_description>A court of justice is the government’s power, set out in stone and marble, for the people to respect and fear.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs such, this building adds significantly to the repression of the people in the region where it stands. Further, because the forces of law and order are in intimate partnership with the government’s tax gatherers, a law court gives their demands for money even more force. The tax gathered in a region also increases thanks to the court. Finally, the judges here have the power to use civil law to help the military’s authority and this means that they can aid military recruitment, if only by the simple expedient of sentencing wrongdoers to the ranks!\n\nSocial order is often more important than any amount of so-called liberty to the smooth running of a nation. To modern eyes, a court of justice was surprisingly parsimonious with the justice it dispensed: its purpose was to enforce laws that protected the status quo, which did not have to be the same thing as “justice”. Receiving justice depended more upon the social class of the defendant or plaintiff, and less upon clever legal argument or the law itself. Even in countries that prided themselves on “liberty”, such as Britain, the law courts were more interested in protecting the rights of property rather than the rights of common and poor men.</long_description>

<short_description>The force of law, symbolised by this court, is a powerful weapon in a government’s armoury.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe court is the power of the state rendered in magnificent fashion and, even if appeals are successful, it helps keep order by greatly adding to the repression in the region. Given that the state acts as prosecutor and pays the judges, who understand where their duty lies, it is also an effective way of punishing those who choose not to support the state. Legal sanctions back demands for tax, and there may be little point in a man arguing against them. The courts also have the power to enforce military demands for recruits.\n\nWithout an appeals procedure, courts of law had no means of self-correction or review: the decision of the judge was absolute and final. Appeals to a king, consul or president were sometimes possible, but executive mercy was often whimsical and based on social position or political expediency. In theory, an appeals court removed politics and social standing from the application of law, although in practice this was rarely the case. Simply put: a gentleman or merchant had the money to pay for an appeal, while a poor man did not. This one fact alone made the courts a subtle tool of social repression and control.</long_description>

<short_description>A supreme court is the most magnificent setting for legal matters, but it is also a symbol of the rule of law.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAnd those laws may have a great deal to do with keeping the people in order, rather than granting them life and liberty. This building adds greatly to the repression of the people and, because of the sanctions that judgements here can impose, it also makes the job of tax collection much more efficient. An errant taxpayer dragged before this court should be in fear of losing more than just his purse! The threat of law is also the sanction that is required for recruiting soldiery.\n\nIn addition to his military genius, Napoleon is also well known for his code of laws, the Code Civil, that established an easily understood legal framework in 1805. This was not the only law code that the Revolution produced. The Penal Code of 1791 simplified the criminal justice system too. Despite being codes of justice, the codes were not all that fair to everyone concerned: the accused in a criminal case, for example, was not necessarily allowed a defence lawyer. By not being bound by precedent, cases were argued on their apparent merits, not on whether previous legal judgements could be used to sway the judge with the power of tradition.</long_description>

<key>sArmy1_cantonment_european</key>
<short_description>This building allows basic military units to be recruited.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is extremely useful for all governments to be able to keep a visible military presence in the country, a reminder that “the rod and the axe” are available, should they be needed. This is true even in countries where liberty and freedom are trumpeted loudly: too much liberty, especially among the lower orders of society, is a dangerous thing. It is equally important to keep soldiers apart from the common folk; disorder and crime nearly always follow when they are allowed to mix.\n\nHistorically, most military cantonments or encampments had a distinctly non-military appearance. Most armies had a huge train of sutlers to provide food and drink, wagon masters for transport, armourers and smiths for weapons and gear, pioneers, holy men, hangers-on, hawkers and officers’ servants. Alongside these was another army of wives, children, and the inevitable prostitutes plying their trade to officers and men alike. States recognised that these people were necessary to the smooth running of armies, but that did not mean that they made life easy for them, or looked after them in any way. On campaign, units had an allowance of wives, but those women left behind would have to shift for themselves and hope for a portion of their men’s pay.</long_description>

<key>sArmy2_barracks_european</key>
<short_description>A barracks allows a selection of military units to be recruited.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBarracks provide housing, armouries, and stabling for most kinds of soldiers and their mounts, along with the space necessary for them to be trained in the basics of military life.  Sensibly, they are usually also designed to be defensible, even if there are town walls, and an imposing symbol of government solidity and power. The barracks are a bulwark for the power of the ruling classes: the local authorities can send men to deal with all enemies, foreign and domestic. The place can even serve as a prison, should the locals prove troublesome!\n\nMany governments at the start of the 19th Century were still using troops for domestic policing duties, particularly against troublemakers in the new industrial factory towns that were appearing. Soldiers were there to keep order and, in doing so, protect the property of the wealthy middle and upper classes. This did not mean that having troops barracked in a town was popular, even among those they were defending. While it might be acceptable to invite a captain of dragoons to dine, soldiers were a group apart and considered a necessary, sometimes very necessary, evil. The popularity of soldiers was always tied to the perceived threats from foreign nations.</long_description>

<key>sArmy3_drill_school_european</key>
<short_description>A drill school trains soldiers to obey standardised military procedures. It also allows military units to be recruited.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDrill is not simply a means of keeping soldiers busy by having them march up and down. On the battlefield all manoeuvres must be performed exactly, at the correct time, if a unit is not to be shot down or cut to pieces. Every man must be drilled to perform his part correctly when a unit moves from a line formation to square, else confusion will result. Obedience to orders must be second nature: a soldier who is concentrating on not attracting the attention of his sergeant will also be too busy to worry about the enemy! Long hours of drill do have another, inadvertent benefit: men on a parade ground are not in the local tavern.\n\nDrill, for all its boredom for the men, was a vital practice for all armies of the Napoleonic period. Even the armies of France realised that revolutionary zeal was not enough, and some order had to be brought to battle. Many armies, however, were late in adopting a single drill manual for their forces; for a few fortunate and literate officers, this was a godsend. They could earn quite handsome additional funds by producing privately written drill books.</long_description>

<key>sArmy4_military_academy_european</key>
<short_description>A military academy trains young officers, and improves the recruitment of military units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn most countries military command, especially in peacetime, is usually limited to the sons of the ruling and propertied classes: only those with a significant stake in the survival of a nation will defend it properly. However, the counter-argument is that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, even if extremely well bred, may not be good enough. Military academies take in those who have talent, and teach the theory and practice of the military art. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as tradesmen because of this vulgar professionalism.\n\nThe French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and led the way in military teaching with the creation of a “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen”, which neatly subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. On the other hand, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided for the orphans of officers, with no more than a vague hope that the pupils would follow their fathers into the army.</long_description>

<key>sArmy5_staff_college_european</key>
<short_description>A staff college trains officers in the strategies needed to win wars, and improves the recruitment of military units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTactics win battles, but running an army requires far more from the officers in charge. It is not enough to get men to a battlefield: they must be armed, supplied, fed, shod, and trained before any general can turn them into a victorious tool of the state.\n\nIn practice, this meant that officers were taught a wide range of skills, beyond being able to organise a regiment. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers were taught military illustration, a vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams, some surveying, military law, horsemanship, weapons handling, and given character-building instruction. This last item included instruction, when regrettably necessary, in how to behave like a proper gentleman. In many countries, students were expected to pay their own fees, partly to ensure that only the best families sent their sons to the colleges. By all accounts, Napoleon Bonaparte did not listen to many lessons in being a gentleman, or chose to behave like a parvenu boor on occasion in order to annoy as many stuck-up dignitaries as possible!</long_description>

<key>sCannon1_cannon_foundry_european</key>
<short_description>Cannon foundries make guns and the associated ammunition and equipment for artillerymen.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA cannon foundry allows artillery units to be recruited. Cannon production has improved greatly since 1700, as the invention of machine tools and better methods of casting have made producing cannons a much safer occupation. The changes also mean that the guns themselves are far more reliable. Their range and accuracy are vastly better than early 18th century pieces, which were usually made using the same technique as bell founding.\n\nBefore the 19th century advances in cannon production making guns, like any casting work, was a dangerous business. If the sand moulds were even slightly damp then a steam explosion could occur. Anyone nearby was likely to be killed or maimed by hot or molten metal and pieces of the mould.</long_description>

<key>sCannon2_ordnance_factory_european</key>
<short_description>An ordnance factory designs and manufactures guns and their associated equipment.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly retained by the state, even in a republic. The creation of large guns is also a difficult business, and the state is the only body that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns, rather than buy them from foreigners, is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory allows artillery units to be recruited.\n\nHistorically, most ordnance factories began in royal ownerships, giving the monarch a guaranteed access to heavy cannons. These were needed for destroying the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. In Britain, for example, the Master of the Ordnance was often a member of the cabinet, and many royal households across Europe included a post of Master Gunner. Even the Ottoman Turks, who had a strong tradition of heavy artillery production, were careful to make sure the Sublime Porte had master gunners on staff.</long_description>

<key>sCannon3_great_arsenal_european</key>
<short_description>A great arsenal is a huge manufactory for artillery pieces and allows artillery units to be recruited.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and is one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, and central control of heavy artillery is a wise policy. Large guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively and advances in this field allow new artillery units to be recruited. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery.\n\nHistorically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot, and powder. Domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery to be deployed. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on an appropriate carriage and used in anger. The gun carriage used for a barrel would determine its use; a gun for use in fortifications did not need to be dragged across open country. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners: dried out or damp powder would not burn evenly and could cause gun barrels to burst when fired.</long_description>

<short_description>This council of state is charged with looking after all matters relating to artillery and improves the recruitment of military units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe board is in charge of the design, development, casting, and storage of artillery pieces for the armed forces. The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, an attempt to limit bureaucratic muddle and rivalry between services. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and a measure of state power.\n\nHistorically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. Looking after the monarch’s artillery train required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors, and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance. As with all government departments, they made sure that their power increased over time, and they eventually controlled the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the state.</long_description>

<key>sCannon5_engineer_school_european</key>
<short_description>Military engineering needs much study to be practiced well.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe school teaches all the specialised skills that an officer of engineers will require, such as surveying, the use of explosives, military architecture, construction, the arts of siege warfare, military illustration to create maps, and much else besides. Some tactical skills are taught as well, but engineers are not usually expected to command armies and issue orders to gentlemen of quality. However, this hard-won knowledge helps create better officers and improves the recruitment of military units.\n\nSappers and miners, like artillery experts, had a long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and common pioneers!</long_description>

<short_description>A school offers education to the children of those willing to pay the fees. In some schools, subsidies from religious or charitable groups may be available. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is not a right or even considered much of a privilege in many societies. The skills of reading (a little), hunting, and beating recalcitrant servants are the only worthwhile accomplishments of “proper gentlemen”. A smattering of religious education puts a veneer of civilization on top.\n\nThe emerging middle and mercantile classes value education a good deal more highly, and pay for it to be drummed into their children! A few schools, mostly the work of charities and religious bodies, exist to teach the children of the deserving poor, or give orphans some kind of start in life.\n\nThe British system of state education and “public schools” (which are actually non-state, private schools) owes its confusing terminology to this period. Public schools were open to the public – the public who could pay – while private schools took pupils as they saw fit. British mass “state education” would have to wait for another century. State education existed in some countries, but always ran the risk of creating an imbalance between learning and obedient loyalty if it was extended much beyond those with a real stake in society.</long_description>

<short_description>Sensation and spectacle keep everyone occupied and entertained, and safely distracted from politics.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting and novel experience. It improves the happiness of all social classes and actually increases the town’s wealth slightly. Audiences are aggressively critical and show little respect: heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. The chattering classes eagerly await each new performance, each great actor-manager, and each new work.\n\nHistorically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was once forced to kneel before a fickle audience. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped formal censorship of plays in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have its approval for every production. The censorious instinct still runs deep in some countries and some governments to this day.</long_description>

<short_description>Entertainment improves the happiness of all classes and helps to improve town wealth.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn opera house is a sumptuous theatre for the performance of highly stylized musical plays. The self-important and the genuinely important often attend to be seen rather than for amusement, but the “lower orders” are often genuinely entertained and distracted from the difficulties of life. No expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. They rival many great palaces with the luxury of their fixtures and fittings, as the public areas for the audience are at least as important as what is happening on stage. Having a prestigious opera house will improve town wealth as it draws crowds from far and wide.\n\nIn the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that mercifully ended before the Napoleonic period was the use of castrati: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range.</long_description>

<short_description>Poetry is a form of literature held in high regard throughout the Turkish, Persian and Arab-speaking world by all the educated classes of society.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe styles and hidden allegorical meanings of poems take much time to master, and there is a rich set of traditions to draw on from all three languages. A school of poetry teaches all of the subtle nuances of poetry, and provides a good basis for those who wish to become court poets throughout the Empire, a rewarding position for those who have talent. The presence of these talented artists, capable of spinning tales to distract and amaze brings inner peace and happiness to all classes and improves the town wealth of a region.\n\nHistorically, Ottoman “divan” poetry used Persian forms and many borrowed words, as Turkish did not suit the Persian rhyming schemes. Arab poetry generally could be a great many styles, some of which needed careful handling if they were to avoid offending religious sensibilities. Members of the Ottoman court were expected to be fluent in all three languages, Turkish, Persian, and Arabic, as well as having a good grasp of court etiquette and a masterful skill at calligraphy. These delicate art forms set the educated upper classes apart from the lower, who had their own spoken storytelling and poetic traditions.</long_description>

Music is open to everyone and as a result the happiness of all classes is improved, although only the upper classes can afford the best seats and boxes. Little expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the public areas visited by the important members of the audience. This prestigious building markedly improves the town wealth in its region.\n\nMany rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. Music advanced tremendously, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel and Scarlatti. Composers dedicated their works to great men, carried away by admiration or in the hope of patronage. The ideals of the French Revolution inspired Beethoven when he was writing his third symphony, the “Eroica”, but after Napoleon crowned himself Emperor, Beethoven furiously scratched out the dedication to him.</long_description>

<short_description>Formal gardens are a place of quiet contemplation, where all classes can go to relax and leave the cares of the world behind.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe tulip is a native flower of, among other places, Anatolia, and the flower has long been prized by the Ottomans. Planted in formal gardens, the design of which owes much to the Persian “paradise garden”, they are a spectacular display of shape and colour. The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that, bringing peace, tranquillity and happiness to all citizens, regardless of social class.\n\nDespite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on bulbs! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many shocked and penniless. The Ottomans, altogether more sensible folk, simply enjoyed the tulip for its beauty, which they regarded as a gift from Allah, the Merciful.</long_description>

Pride in the nation improves the happiness of everyone, regardless of class and the revenue collected from this building significantly improved town wealth.\n\nHistorically, private museums and displays had developed from the collections in “cabinets of curiosities”, and some of these had ended up as government or royal property. The world-famous British Museum began in just this way, when Sir Hans Sloane’s collection was left to George II so that it could be preserved for the nation. Now a wonderful collection of antiquities, the Museum was intended to be a universal collection, and had natural history, geology, and science exhibits.</long_description>

National standing compared to other nations is vastly important in matters of diplomacy, so a public demonstration of national power will improve prestige.\n\nThis theatre in the heart of Vienna was built thanks to the efforts of Emanuel Schikander. Although he started as an actor he was soon leading his own company and performing plays set to the music of Mozart. It was the Magic Flute, set to music by Mozart, that propelled Schikander to the height of his fame. The play also helped in the building of the Theater an der Wien: Schikander’s lavish productions had outgrown the smaller Theater auf de Wieden and required a more sumptuous setting. This need for grandeur proved to be the downfall of Schikander, who eventually died penniless and insane on the streets of Vienna.</long_description>

The government agreed to fund the construction of a new building and Trafalgar Square was chosen as the best location. The construction of the National Gallery was completed in 1838 and the amazing collection remains open to the public.</long_description>

This name remained with the building until the reign of Napoleon, when it was renamed in his honour. A bust of Napoleon by Bartolini was installed over the entrance. Napoleon went on to expand the collections during his campaigns by looting, although most countries claimed their treasures back following the fall of the Empire in 1815.</long_description>

<key>settlement_fortifications</key>
<short_description>Defences constructed around a town will hold off many attacks, but cannot be expected to resist heavy attacks forever.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSettlement defences are seldom allowed to be truly impregnable defences. Practical matters such as cost, or the need to house a growing population, often stop city fathers from investing fully in their own defences. Instead, their defences are good enough to deter a casual attack, and good enough to hold up an enemy’s advance. Interlocking fields of fire can sweep attackers off the glacis as the defenders reap a terrible toll. It takes a disciplined approach to reduce a settlement’s fortifications to the point where a breach is “practicable” and the town can be taken.\n\nHistorically, town garrisons were often offered the “honours of war” and allowed to march away with their weapons, but only if they gave up without a fight. The townsfolk were likely to be spared any indignity. Once, however, the attackers had launched an assault then the town, its inhabitants and the garrison were fair game for any amount of pillaging and looting. The assault was a dangerous business, and a lawless orgy afterwards was often the soldiers’ reward.</long_description>

<key>settlement_fortifications_improved</key>
<short_description>As settlements grow there is a need for more elaborate defence in depth. The fortifications are designed to intimidate any attacking force, and then kill them.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nExtensive fortifications cost huge sums of money and much effort. There is little point in constructing them unless they are maintained and needed for the future survival and prosperity of a town. A defensive wall is good for a sense of security, but it does not feed a hungry family after a poor local harvest! As a practical matter, then, these fortifications are erected along borders and around towns of real strategic significance.\n\nThe defences are laid out according to the latest military fashions, and as well built as any purely military fortifications. This can cause local problems, as prime building land is either used for the forts themselves, or must be kept clear to provide excellent fields of fire. During long periods of peace, the city fathers must resist the temptation to cover the killing zones with houses and commercial properties!\n\nHistorically, fortresses created by Marshal Vauban of France dominated their towns for centuries. The defences of Strasbourg, in Alsace, are typical of his work, and were a clear geographical boundary until the end of the 19th Century.</long_description>

<short_description>A star fort is a cunning system of defensive positions with interlocking fields of fire.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese fortifications cover the city approaches with artillery forts, protecting it from assault. The defences allow a settlement to hold out a little longer when under siege. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. Anyone approaching the fort can be shot at from several directions; no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry.\n\nHistorically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshal Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. Despite his designs being over 100 years old by the time of Napoleon, they were still fearsomely hard to take. His defences at Verdun were still considered good enough to be used by the French army during the epic siege in 1916, during the First World War.</long_description>

<short_description>Star forts are massive defensive works, making any assault a truly terrifying prospect for the attackers.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese fortifications surround a town’s approaches, protecting it from assault. The scale of the defences allows a settlement to hold out for longer when under siege. The star-shaped plan of the fort means fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. The attackers face an uphill struggle across the fort’s glacis, with no cover at all, with a counterscarp, or ditch, waiting for them.\n\nHistorically, and providing that money was no object, a star fort could become a baroque and complex maze of artillery fire and death. An assiduous military engineer could add additional ravelins, or detached triangular bastions, in front of the fort’s own walls; and hornworks and crownworks, both elaborations of the basic bastion design, to the fort as well. The only limit to the defences was a practical one of artillery and musket range: no wall could be longer than a flanking musket volley range, or blind spots in the defences might be created.</long_description>

<short_description>Renting to tenants may not generate a high enough income for a landowner. It can be more profitable to displace people by an animal cash crop.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Meat and wool demand increases rapidly as towns grow. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting. While this generates little income, it does give social status.\n\nThe “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Contrary to popular belief, Highland clan leaders carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clans into exile. The chieftains needed to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did.</long_description>

<short_description>The largest estates can have a huge acreage turned over to the pleasure of their owners. Pleasure in a carefully manicured nature is secondary to the need to make money!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe largest estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-like grand houses in the latest styles and built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes. In the interests of art and beauty the workers, their homes, and their farms are removed from the land.\n\nHistorically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and gothic follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today, if only as tourist attractions.</long_description>

<short_description>The basis of all agriculture is the humble peasant, labouring in the field to bring in his master’s crops or to keep his master’s animals alive. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDay-to-day life for a peasant farmer has barely changed in a thousand years. It is a short, hard life of abject poverty and backbreaking labour. He can expect nothing better than to work and die in the same village, tilling the same fields, his life bounded by the same horizon. Peasant farms are not terribly efficient: the landowners have little interest in anything beyond their rents and tithes. The problem for them is that peasant economies are, by their very nature, cash poor and most income is in kind, and there is a limit to where you can spend a goat!\n\nHistorically, life for a peasant was pretty much the same all over the world: work from dawn to dusk. In Russia, the peasants were serfs tied to the land and the property of the landowner as much as any cow or goat. In India, peasants were a caste locked into their social position by hallowed custom. The system eventually broke down in Western Europe thanks to industrialization needing a constant supply of workers and changes in land usage.</long_description>

<short_description>Tenant farmers are a huge social step up from the humble peasant. They may toil as hard, but they do so for their own profit not that of a distant master. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, so subsistence farming is a waste of time, as it will not generate any income. Successful tenants, who develop the land, can become quietly wealthy men and may be able to buy their farms. \n\nFor a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms is that income from them is in cash, not kind. Absentee landlords can therefore live the high life in a city; they rarely need trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside – as long as they have trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arises, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers.\n\nHistorically, tenanted farms made good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Tenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus.</long_description>

<short_description>A shipwright needs somewhere to build ships, even if this is only a slipway and a timber yard – but any piece of firm foreshore will do for smaller vessels! </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe services of a smithy within the yard are also very useful, as most ships use a surprising amount of bespoke ironwork in their construction, not to mention hundreds of nails! A shipyard can produce smaller vessels and carry out repairs and maintenance too. Careening is a regular chore for wooden vessels: hulls become fouled with weeds and barnacles that cause drag and slow the vessel. A shipyard has all the gear necessary to empty a ship, then haul it onto a beach or slipway so that it can be scraped clean and washed by the tides.\n\nHistorically, shipyards needed a good source of timber close by, or were on the estuaries of navigable rivers (so that wood could be shipped from further inland to the yard). Buckler’s Hard on the Beaulieu River in the New Forest in southern England is a typical shipyard in where it was constructed. However, it is larger than many, and had an extensive staff of artisans and could handle two ships at once. The shipwrights of Buckler’s Hard built HMS Agamemnon, Admiral Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship, in 1781; many of the crew were equally attached to their captain, and followed him to later commands.</long_description>

<key>small_arms_factory_european</key>
<short_description>A large manufactory for producing the enormous numbers of weapons, blades and firearms, required for a contemporary army. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCentralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies: equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and makes supply issues easier to manage. It also cuts down on the chances of manufacturers supplying shoddy or downright dangerous firearms, something that is always a temptation for profit-minded contractors.\n\nA small arms factory does not replace private arms manufacturers. While the soldiers make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.\n\nHistorically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess Land Pattern” muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and remained in service for over a century each, with minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land; ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments.</long_description>

The arch was fashioned after the monuments of Imperial Rome, and it stands at an impressive 162 feet tall, making it the tallest triumphal arch in the world. It has been used to commemorate the French dead of both World Wars, and is the site of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Buried there in 1921, this unidentified body acts as a symbolic representation of all those unknown French soldiers who died in the Great War.</long_description>

However, it took so long to build that when it was eventually finished in 1873 Prussia had succeeded in winning two more wars! These later victories, against France and Austria, were the reason why a statue of the goddess Victoria was added to the top of the sandstone pillar. The base of the pillar was decorated with four bronze reliefs that depict the three victories and the glorious return of Prussian troops to Berlin.</long_description>

<short_description>Roads improve communications within a region: goods and, more importantly, armies can move at a better speed along maintained roads.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSome effort is put into maintaining the main roads, improving the carriageway and providing working drainage for rainwater. If nothing else, the building of roads is a useful way of getting some value from the feckless, workshy, and undeserving poor. Honest men who pay their taxes expect some return for their support of the naturally indolent and the unfortunates who have been thrown out of work.\n\nHistorically, there was also a military imperative to improve roads, even if the change was from a rutted cart track to a smooth cart track. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid responses to enemy or rebellious activity. It is far easier to haul artillery pieces along any kind of road rather than across country. With the Enlightenment’s conscious harking back to the Classical era, there was also a desire to emulate the achievements of Rome, even in something as small as roadways.</long_description>

<short_description>These well-built roads, surfaced with stone, are able to carry much heavy traffic, including military forces.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMaking a cobbled road is an incredibly laborious business. Each small paving stone must be shaped, placed and mortared into position. If done properly, the road also requires foundations, a carefully judged camber to carry away rainwater, and drainage. The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not very comfortable: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!\n\nIn practice the expense of cobbling a road, and the attractive finish that cobbles produced, meant that the surface was only used where the nobility or propertied classes were likely to see or use it. The great and the good could hardly be expected to wallow along in the mud and horse dung like common folk! The poor did, however, find a use for cobbles: lifted from the road, they were a perfect fist-sized lump of rock for hurling at the unpopular representatives of law and order. In his later years, the Duke of Wellington, by then the British Prime Minister, was not called the “Iron Duke” for his military qualities, but thanks to his carriage’s iron shutters, there to protect him from the many rocks that were chucked in his direction!</long_description>

<short_description>A metalled road is surfaced with small broken stones, providing a long-lasting roadway for military and civilian traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe road is actually constructed in layers of differently sized stones, starting with large rocks as the foundation, and layers of smaller stones on top. Each layer is compressed when it is laid with a heavy roller. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly, as there are always small gaps for rainwater to trickle through. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to users of such excellent roads and turnpikes, as they are often constructed for profit. Metalled roads in a region allow military forces to travel with great speed.\n\nTechnically, “metalled roads” do not require a tarmac surface to be termed “metalled”: a concrete surface is also a metalled road. Roads were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836). His idea was a success, although a “McAdamised” finish was not called “tarmac” until 1901!</long_description>

<key>star_fort_earthworks_european</key>
<short_description>Star forts can be improved and extended with outlying earthworks and extra defences to make any attack a truly terrifying prospect. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe basic concept of a star fort is that at least one, and preferably many, field of fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. These killing zones can be extended and made even more deadly by, at the very least, a long sloping glacis around the fort for the attackers to scale. The glacis need not be very steep at all, but the attackers face an uphill struggle with no cover at all, under murderous fire ever step of the way. The glacis also acts as a passive defence, a sloping armoured earthwork for the fort proper. Beyond the glacis a hidden counterscarp awaits: a retaining wall (sometimes with firing positions for the defenders) that drops down deep ditch that must be crossed before the actual approaches to the fort are even reached!\n\nAll of these defences are before the military architects add additional ravelins (detached triangular bastions or gun positions) in front of the fort’s own walls and hornworks and crownworks (both elaborations on the basic bastion design). The whole effect, when viewed in plan form, is baroque in its complexity, each projection of the central star giving the defence another firing position towards any attacking force. Wall length is limited to that which can be covered by flanking musket fire, as experience showed that a fort with only cannons in its defence could be taken when the cannons were knocked out.</long_description>

<short_description>This imposing fort is a difficult objective for any attacker, and a clear symbol of power; cost is secondary matter after magnificence!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBy European standards, this fortress looks like something of a relic from an earlier age, but to underestimate the defences would be very foolish. Packed earth ramparts behind the thick, high walls not only give extra fighting space to the defenders, but also deaden enemy cannon fire, absorbing the impact of shot and shell. Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.\n\nHistorically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The quality of workmanship demanded was extremely high, even palatial in its luxurious attention to detail. The Red Fort at Agra remains an outstanding example of Mughal architecture, a fusion of native Indian, Persian and Islamic styles that remains impressive even today. Over 3000 people lived within its walls at one point, and the defences were certainly capable of protecting many more.</long_description>

<short_description>A star fort is an enormous system of bastions and defensive positions with interlocking fields of fire: an intimidating obstacle to any attacker!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.\n\nPassive defence, however, is not enough. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry. \n\nHistorically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshall Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. His defences at Verdun were still in use during the battle there in 1916 during the First World War.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive fort is a major obstacle to any invader, and a powerful symbol of domination over the local people. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWith thick, high walls, impressive towers and many gun positions, the impression created by a fort for any attacker is of overwhelming strength. It will take time and effort to invest such a fort, break its walls with cannon fire and then organise an attack. All the while, the attackers will be prey to disease, starvation and the climate! The defenders may only have to wait for the attackers’ will to fail.\n\nBeyond Europe, the fortification ideas of Vauban and others did not really take root until the arrival of European powers and armies. Traditional fort designs continued in use because they were good enough for their purpose: they intimidated local rebels, and were difficult for them to assault because, as noted, they were unlikely to have substantial artillery siege trains. The “old fashioned” designs were therefore good enough when it took a courageous commander, or a lucky one, to mount a successful attack. There are, however, accounts of an Able Seaman Strahan single-handedly (!) capturing the “fort” (the size is not specified) at Baj-Baj on the Hooghly River in Bengal during Robert Clive’s 1756 campaign.</long_description>

<short_description>A steam drydock is a magnificent achievement of an industrializing nation: a manufactory for ships without equal!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe kind of beam engines used to pump water around a canal system (and drain mines) can drain a drydock efficiently. Using steam to power these engines is an obvious step, but once steam engines are in a dockyard their use goes far beyond pumping seawater around. \n\nThey can be used to drive sawmills, lathes, even block-making machines and as the lifting power for dockside cranes. The efficiency gains – admittedly with some new risk of fire, as the main shipbuilding material is wood – are impressive! \n\nThe scale of the military-naval industry could be huge in maritime nations, even discounting civilian yards. The British Royal Navy dockyards were the largest industrial organisation in the world during the 18th Century, and could make every part of a warship from a mast to a nail; guns were the exception, as they came from the Board of Ordnance. The ropewalk at Chatham, Kent, produced anchor ropes and was the longest brick building in Europe when constructed. It is still producing high quality ropes for ships today. The dockyards were so important that damaging them by fire or explosion carried the death penalty – something not actually repealed until 1971 (two years after the UK death penalty was finally abolished for murder).</long_description>

<short_description>As soon as a mine delves below the water table, water is a problem and flooding a constant danger. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nPumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. \n\nHistorically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had problems and was very inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was cheap. It was an atmospheric engine because the steam was never under pressure, and relied on a partial vacuum forming when the steam cooled, thus sucking the piston down the cylinder. The need to repeatedly warm and then cool the machine made it wasteful. \n\nJames Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient. He had a separate steam condenser, and kept the cylinder at a constant temperature. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner, Matthew Boulton, who proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist: he even persuaded the British Parliament to extend their patent, guaranteeing them further profit!</long_description>

<key>stockade_european</key>
<short_description>A stockade is a simple defensive structure, quickly built from logs. Stockades always have a curiously temporary air, even if they have been in use for years.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe walls are logs driven vertically into the ground and sharpened at the top to make a crude, thick fence. When defended properly this is enough to keep out most attackers.\n\nThis is the reason why a firing step for troops is usually constructed inside using either banked turf or earth rammed up against the logs. This banking has the additional benefit of giving some resilience against light artillery fire. A stockade cannot be expected to stand up to a serious pounding by cannons.\n\nHistorically, they were common on the American frontier where they were used as patrolling bases for contingents of light troops and local levies. Often in North America a crude stockade and the European flag fluttering above it were the only indication that you had arrived in “civilized” territory.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe sights, sounds, and smells of a modern market differ somewhat to the days of old. Now they team with goods from all over the world, coffee from the Ottoman Turks, wool from Britain, furs from the United States, and spices from India. This wide variety of commodities helps to increase industrial wealth as well as town wealth.\n\nNapoleon attempted to use trade and the restriction thereof to cripple the British war effort. He correctly understood that money was the basis of British power. His attack on Egypt, as well as serving his own interests, was intended to destroy, eventually, Britain’s trade in India. When Napoleon took control of France he continued his attempted strangulation of Britain’s trade by issuing a number of decrees against trade with Britain. The first of these was the Berlin Decree of 1806. The British government responded with a blockade of French-controlled Europe and ordered Royal Navy vessels to seize any ships, hostile or neutral, violating the blockade.</long_description>

Nathan Mayer Rothschild established his business in London and was responsible for handling the gold bullion that was sent to Wellington for his war effort in Portugal and Spain. Rothschild took a small percentage commission for handling what turned out to be millions in gold. With important, and profitable, transactions like these the Rothschilds were set up a network of family branches to handle business the world over.

As these houses accumulate greater wealth they become increasingly powerful.\n\nHistorically, one of the oldest merchant banks in Britain was the Barings Bank, established in 1762 by father and son Francis and John Baring. They were best known for their involvement in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. The United States of America wanted to purchase the territory of Louisiana from the French, but impending war with Britain led to a French refusal to accept the bonds that America offered as payment. During the temporary period of peace, Barings acted as an intermediary between the two countries, buying the bonds at a cut down price from Napoleon and providing him with the equivalent gold, which came to $8,831,250. Barings is better remembered today for its spectacular collapse in 1995, after speculation by one of its traders broke the bank.</long_description>

<short_description>Each turn a college may produce a gentleman, and it always helps with research into new technologies.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA college offers an academic education, perhaps a veneer of sophistication, to the sons of the aristocracy, the gentry, and the merchant classes. It may also, unintentionally, expose these people to the dangerous concept of thinking about the world, and that can create a wish for reform, if the world’s many injustices are considered.\n\nHistorically, a college education usually required substantial wealth, as there were scholarships or charitable places for the talented poor. Although science and philosophy were on the curriculum, the ideas taught were usually socially and politically conservative rather than radical. College masters were unlikely to see any reasons for upsetting the wealthy parents of their scholars, and most students saw no reason to question their entrenched privileges. Radicalism was confined to a small number of students, or came out in rebellious and extremely bad behaviour involving local taverns, bawdyhouses, and “actresses”. Rebellion could always be curbed by a dose of the pox, or a threat from father to cut off an allowance!</long_description>

<short_description>This is a bastion of learning and academic thought, where the arts, theology and sciences are carefully taught.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA university offers young men from good families a fine education, and the chance to study the greatest achievements of mankind. As a result there is a chance that, each turn, this university may produce a gentleman, a useful agent for his nation. The faculty also aids research into new technologies, but may produce a wish for reform among the people; even though the university is socially conservative, it cannot keep all progressive thoughts away from its students.\n\nA good education was useful for those who wished to make their way in the world using talent as well as family connections. A young gentleman’s studies were wide ranging, and not tied to any particular subject area: an awarded degree or doctorate was proof enough of some intellectual achievement. Historically, the established church in many countries had established the universities, and continued to run them. This meant that the university as a body rarely challenged the established order of things; the teachers and students both had vested interests in the status quo. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it should work did emerge, the universities were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.</long_description>

<short_description>This university offers an Islamic education to the sons of the wealthy and influential.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEach turn, there is a chance that the university will produce a scholar of particular note, and the faculty will be of use in researching new technologies. Society does not necessarily want the university to produce radical thinkers, but able, polished men to occupy the high offices of state. Even so, education does tend to produce questioning minds. As Muslims, the students can study not only their faith, but also the law, jurisprudence, science, and history. At the same time, there is also a distinctly Turkish flavour, as Ottoman culture and achievements are celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.\n\nHistorically, Islamic education was among the best on offer anywhere in the world. Subjects ranged across Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch, and other useful trade languages, as well as science, medicine, mathematics, and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, with a better formal education than western Europeans.</long_description>

<short_description>This is a centre of learning and original thought, where the science and art are given free rein.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEach turn, a modern university has a very good chance of producing a gentleman, and it also significantly aids technology research in the region. The liberal thinking that occurs greatly improves the region&apos;s happiness, but also creates a strong desire for reform among the people. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the all the studies undertaken, along with personal pride and ambition. Ideas, however, are not confined to the intellectual elite, but passed on to everyone who can understand: learning inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen.\n\nThe French Revolution was not always kind to scientists. On the one hand, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) did not suffer greatly and was not forced out of the country on account of his Italian birth; Napoleon later named him as one of the Légion d&apos;honneur. On the other hand, Antoine Lavoisier (1743-94), a man rightly hailed as the father of modern chemistry was, in the space of a single day, tried, condemned, and executed on trumped-up charges. His involvement in tax farming possibly counted against him, but in killing Lavoisier, a political liberal as well as a genius, France lost one of the greatest minds of all time.</long_description>

<key>tFactory1_manufactory_european</key>
<short_description>A manufactory adds to industrial wealth in a region and makes the recruitment of artillery units cheaper.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA manufactory creates goods on a large scale. Although this creates new jobs in the local area it has a negative effect on the happiness of the lower classes. The mechanical and repetitive nature of the work produces harsh working conditions. Gone are the days when master craftsmen could take pride in their efforts; instead, men tend machines, or do a single task over and over again.\n\nA “manufactory” was distinguished from a “factory” because goods of some kind were made there, rather than being traded. Every type of item that could be made was eventually turned out by a manufactory somewhere: pottery, cloth, iron, weapons, and so forth. With better transport by canal and river, it also became possible for towns to specialise in the making of a single type of product: Nottingham in England produced enormous quantities of lace, while Northampton, a little to the south, became a centre of shoe manufacture. Wherever coal could be easily mined, there appeared great mills and filthy towns of workers&apos; slums.</long_description>

<short_description>Hives of industry, factories make the recruitment of artillery units significantly cheaper and add to the industrial wealth of a region.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMachines are the wonder of the modern age, allowing tasks previously limited to skilled craftsmen to be handled by the average working man. Productivity and profits are increased ten-fold, adding to the industrial wealth of a region. This does little to please the lower classes, who have awful working conditions foisted upon them.\n\nOne of the first factories in Britain, in the modern sense of the word, was Richard Arkwright’s Cromford Mill in Derbyshire in northern England. Unlike mills of the past, it was purpose-built to house machinery designed by Arkwright himself. The factory’s design was so successful that similar mills were established all along the Derwent Valley in Derbyshire. Towns quickly sprang up around these mills and the houses were purposely arranged to make the mill the centre of town. The need to find overseas markets for factory-made goods was one of the driving forces of British expansionism and aggressive trading.</long_description>

<key>tFactory3_steam_powered_factory_european</key>
<short_description>Harnessing the power of steam to machinery increases the industrial wealth in a region and makes the recruitment of artillery units a great deal cheaper.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSteam power allows factories to be built away from rivers, because water wheels are no longer a limit on where they can be built. This opens up large areas of countryside that had previously been unsuitable for mills and factories. However, such industrialisation makes the lower classes miserable, due to their harsh working and living conditions.\n\nHistorically, the introduction of steam power to industry in the 19th century did change the way that mills and factories worked. It was no longer necessary to build them in valleys, where rivers could be diverted for power. A central boiler house and engine shed provided all the power, and this was fed into the rest of the factory through drive shafts and belts. It became increasingly dangerous to work in factories, as the machinery itself could now be operated at a much higher speed. Accidents were nearly always blamed on the workers, who received no compensation for any injuries or deaths. Some factory owners stopped wages for everyone when there was an accident, because they made no profits while machinery was being cleared of blood and body parts.</long_description>

<short_description>Soldiers will always need weapons. This building aids, and lowers the cost of, recruiting military units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA gunsmith specialises in the design, building and repair of firearms. Gunsmiths are skilled craftsmen who need an expert knowledge of metallurgy and a fine eye for detail. Being able to arm soldiers is, of course, an important requirement for raising effective units. A gunsmith’s factory, however, is not a pleasant place for the lowly artisans who do most of the actual work.\n\nOwning a good pair of duelling pistols was a must for many gentlemen, even though duelling was largely frowned upon and even illegal in some countries. This didn’t stop some of the most influential men of the time owning pistols. Napoleon owned a set personally designed for him by the influential French engineer, Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The most famous individual to fight a duel was probably the Duke of Wellington: in 1829 he fought a duel against the 9th Earl of Winchelsea. Both men fired into the air, as the point was to satisfy honour, not kill each other.</long_description>

<short_description>Among other benefits, this large manufactory makes it cheaper to the recruit infantry units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCentralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies. Equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and thereby improves the recruitment of military units. While the rank and file make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.\n\nHistorically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess” Land Pattern muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and both remained in service for over a century with only minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land: ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments.</long_description>

<short_description>Improving weapon production makes it much cheaper to recruit infantry units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBy consolidating weapon production into one government-controlled factory the cost of weapons is significantly lessened and the quality of pieces also improves. Unfortunately, the harsh working conditions of these factories leave the lower classes miserable and disgruntled about their lot in life.\n\nHistorically, the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, London was built under the instruction of the British Board of Ordinance towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The factory was eventually completed in 1816, too late to be of any immediate use, and began production of rifles and muskets. Swords were not produced until 1823. The site chosen for the factory was next to the River Lee, as this gave power for the machines and a means of transport. The Enfield factory would go on to make some of the most famous weapons used by the British army, including the .303 Lee-Enfield Rifle, or SMLE, another standard infantry weapon that was in service for many decades.</long_description>

<short_description>Sensation and spectacle for the people can keep them occupied and entertained, not to mention distracted from politics.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting, and novel experience. The theatre holds up a mirror to society, and sometimes society does not like what it sees. The audience show little respect, heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. Yet each great performance, each actor-manager, each new work, is eagerly followed by the chattering classes.\n\nHistorically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was forced to kneel in apology before a fickle audience he had offended. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped censorship of theatres in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have approval for every production.</long_description>

<short_description>An enclosed section of a palace, where the concubines are secluded, ready for the pleasure of their master and away from the lustful gazes of other men. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe word came to English through Italian, where the Turkish “serai” (palace) was confused with the Latin word “sera” (door-bar). A “serai” was any grand palace built around a courtyard, not just a harem. Despite this confusion, there were separate quarters for concubines (Circassian girls were highly prized for their reputedly amazing good looks), and access was tightly controlled.\n\nThe whole idea of a seraglio became something of an obsession in Western Europe, and the subject matter of many works of art in “Turkish” Oriental style, which was quite popular during the 18th Century. Obviously, it combined the exotic and the naughtily erotic in tasteful pictures for the rich! The concept provided the inspiration for Mozart’s opera, “Die Entführung aus dem Serail” (Abduction from the Seraglio), where the hero attempts to rescue his love from the clutches of an Ottoman Pasha. First performed in Austria in 1782 under the (indirect) patronage of the Austrian Emperor, Joseph II, there has to be a suspicion that anti-Turkish sentiment informed the piece. Nevertheless, the opera was a success and personally very profitable for Mozart.</long_description>

<short_description>Virgin forests are a vital strategic as well as economic resource. A logging camp allows the tall timber to be cut and used locally or shipped to the home country. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nApart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons of good quality timber, of many kinds, each. Frames and structural members, for example, are made of oak. Buildings also use large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding.\n\nHistorically, the forests of the eastern seaboard of America were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty.</long_description>

<short_description>A water-powered lumber mill produces logs and sawn timber from the prime forests. Its semi-finished products can then be sold on local markets or shipped to the home market. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is more efficient to ship half-finished planks and logs than tree trunks, thus increasing the profits from logging. Even though most of the equipment used is brought in from home, a lumber mill on a good site can easily repay the investment. The hard work needed to dig a mill pond and race, as well as carefully position a waterwheel is also handsomely repaid when a powered saw starts work.\n\nHistorically, it was possible for a logging operation to denude a forest of all of its profitable trees, in the process causing terrible environmental damage. Without the trees, the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of forest to re-establish itself. This worried hardly anyone in the 18th Century (there were exceptions – some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies), as the world had been given to men to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley.</long_description>

<short_description>A massive enterprise controlling a nation’s trade to one part of the globe, or in certain commodities.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrading companies can be enormous, with fleets of armed merchant ships carrying all manner of cargoes. The successors to the medieval merchant adventurers, they generate fantastic wealth from their operations. Usually granted a government monopoly in either a geographic area or in a set of trade goods, the companies can also act as a privatised diplomatic service in distant corners of the globe. They are known to do deal with local potentates for trade concessions, military access, tax farming and they have taken over native governments by imposing their “advisors”.\n\nHistorically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile mini-states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions. In modern times only petrochemical, mining and arms companies have commanded comparable power over nations.</long_description>

<short_description>Shipping goods of any kind by land is difficult and expensive. Any item that has to travel more than a few miles goes by ship wherever possible. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMost roads are simply terrible, and bulk cargoes (such as coal) must go by ship anyway: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. It also makes the whole world a marketplace, even if the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent (British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no obvious market for it).\n\nCoastal trade can also be very profitable. For example, a “cheese fleet” did nothing but shuttle back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided a preservative for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London.

<short_description>Places of secrecy, member&apos;s clubs help generate spies and improve the happiness of all social classes.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA member&apos;s club is a sanctuary, a place to escape everyday life and spend some time with like-minded fellows. They are also quiet, private places, where secrets can be shared and deals done out of sight of others. They are, in fact, breeding grounds for intrigue, gossip, and double-dealing, making them the perfect breeding ground for unsavoury spies.\n\nHistorically, member&apos;s clubs first appeared in London towards the end of the 18th century. They were highly exclusive in their early years and provided the upper classes with somewhere to gamble, technically an illegal pastime. However, gambling was the least of many evils practised in these clubs. Perhaps the most infamous of these societies was the Hellfire Club, originally established in London in 1719 by the Duke of Wharton, simply for the purposes of debauchery. In 1735, the Irish Hellfire Club was established, and went on to outdo its predecessor in as many foul ways as possible. These included paying defrocked priests to perform mock Catholic masses, sacrificing cats to Satan and, allegedly, on one occasion offering up a dwarf in a diabolic sacrifice. To this day, no one is entirely sure why a dwarf was considered appropriate.</long_description>

<short_description>A place for socialising, the coffee house helps generate spies and improve the happiness of all social classes.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe lure of the coffee house is the hustle and bustle of the place, the gossip that can be overheard, and the business that can be done there. It is the perfect place to meet, well, anyone, for any dark, nefarious, and unpleasant purpose, and all disguised by the perfectly innocent practice of taking a dish of coffee.\n\nCoffee was used first as a stimulant and a digestive in the Islamic world, reserved for mosque officials and medical men. The wonder of a drink that could keep a man awake all night so that he could observe the Moon properly and thereby keep the calendar properly ordered was a blessing indeed. Originally, coffee berries were used in the Yemen to make a kind of tea, but someone, somewhere accidentally stumbled across the idea of roasting the beans to make coffee as we would recognise it today. The brew, made by repeatedly boiling ground beans, was very close to what is now thought of as Turkish coffee, and must have been a welcome stimulant for everyone who tried it. After reaching Constantinople, the coffee habit took a further century before it reached Christian Europe: the first coffee house in Venice was opened in 1645.</long_description>

<short_description>Shh! It’s a secret!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe business of secret societies is, well, secret. What goes on behind their closed doors and in hidden chambers is a mystery, wrapped in misdirection and cloaked in falsehood. This building supports a number of spies and increases the chance that a spy may be produced each turn. It also has a positive effect on the happiness of all classes: who knows who might be watching, or listening? Surely it is better to be happy than attract unwelcome attention with frowns!\n\nSecret societies have always attracted a good deal of attention because of their secrecy, and many have been accused of conspiracies to do everything, from running a single country to running the whole world. Thanks to the secrecy of the Masons, they have often been suspected of many nefarious activities. A typical “secret” society founded in the early 19th Century is American: the “Skull and Bones Society”, set up by Yale University students. Its secrecy probably owed more to a desire not to have parents and university officials know just how much drinking was going on, but in recent years it has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. In 2007 the American CIA felt it necessary to deny rumours that it owed its establishment to a cabal of Skull and Bones members!</long_description>

<short_description>A lodge improves the happiness of all and increases the chance that a spy will be created.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA Masonic lodge is an ideal meeting place for like-minded people to discuss many important and secret matters. Although primarily for the upper and middle classes, a Masonic lodge does improve the happiness of the lower classes. Perhaps they are pleased that their betters are too busy to be regularly horsewhipping them for impudence…\n\nThe first Grand Lodge of the Freemasons was established in England in 1717, when four lodges came together at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St Paul’s churchyard. Just a few years later in 1723 James Anderson wrote ‘The Constitutions of the Free-masons’, and laid out the rules by which the fraternity would be governed. In this document he traced the history of “the craft” all the way back to the Old Testament. Whatever its origins, Masonry spread across Europe with some rapidity during the Age of the Enlightenment, prompting warnings from the Catholic Church and suspicion from both revolutionaries and arch-conservatives.</long_description>

<short_description>The Ottoman secret service improves the happiness of all classes and increases the appearance rate of spies.</short_description>
<long_description>The ever-present threat of the secret service actually has a positive effect on the population: people are not foolish, and will do anything to avoid the attention of the authorities, including being happy! This is also the ideal delivery point for people bringing important and secret information from foreign lands.\n\nHistorically, much foreign intelligence gathering in the Napoleon period was hampered by the refusal of gentlemen to “read other people’s mail”. The Ottoman Empire was much more sensible, and the Yildiz Yeskilati may be the very first formal secret service. Other states had ad hoc arrangements, and certainly intercepted diplomatic messages whenever possible. The term “secret service” has meant many different things over the centuries: the US Secret Service, for example, was given the tightly defined job of fighting dollar counterfeiting and, eventually, the protection of the President. Despite the name, the US Secret Service were not spies!</long_description>

<short_description>A supply post has all the purely military equipment needed to keep an army effective in the field.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn army marches only because the bellies of the soldiers and horses are full and their feet are properly shod. A supply post exists to keep supplies flowing into an army, all the military necessities that cannot be taken from the enemy’s lands by foraging. This is the responsibility of the commissariats, although many field officers would argue that their only mission in life is keeping their account books in order!\n\nThe great soldier-king, Frederick the Great of Prussia, entirely grasped the need for a properly organised system of supplies for his campaigns in Silesia. His rigid tactical system was almost obsolete by the Napoleonic period; indeed, the Prussian army suffered dreadfully for keeping to it when facing French armies. His supply methods, however, including the creation of extensive supply dumps along lines of advance, were a triumph that every general would have done well to study.</long_description>

<short_description>A supply warehouse contains all the military necessities that an army on the march requires, and has the carts needed to move them.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAll armies can, if needs must, forage for supplies in the lands that they pass through. This can ruin the countryside for years, if the depredations are particularly savage. Food, shelter, and firewood are the easily obtainable items, although taking these usually means that the local population starves; is thrown out of its hovels, or palaces; and finds that every stick of furniture has been burned. However, an army cannot forage for what does not exist: gunpowder and arms. These have to be supplied from a central depot of some kind, and carried to the battle by a long train of supply wagons.\n\nUnlike the French and other continental armies, the British army was under orders to refrain from large scale foraging and pillaging. This decision was not based on mercy or some kind of misplaced politeness, but a result of a cold calculation. It was considered a better bargain to pay for most supplies, even if only in promissory notes, than alienate a complete population. As a result, British provosts were sometimes very busy hanging looters, but the British army never really had to worry about “banditti” or “guerillas” falling on their lines of communication.</long_description>

<short_description>A supply depot allows an army to march very efficiently, and still be in a condition to fight after they have marched.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGood generals understand that fighting battles is only a small part of military affairs. Equally important to success is in keeping an army healthy, supplied, and capable. To do this requires organisation and, above all, a good supply corps: a soldier without ammunition might as well not have stayed at home as come to the battlefield.\n\nPart of Napoleon’s genius for military affairs lay in his ability to take existing systems and make them work at full efficiency. His armies simply could not have functioned without a supply system, even though French armies were also much given to plundering, looting, and terrible depredations on foreign civil populations, all in the name of foraging. Stripping a country of everything might feed the men, but it could not provide the purely military supplies that they required: ammunition, powder, and uniforms, even boots. Huge stocks of matériel were required for any army, even one that did not fight, as life in the field wore out everything! Foraging only worked in relatively prosperous lands; one of the reasons that the invasion of Russia ended in disaster was that the Russians themselves destroyed everything in the French path, rather than let them have it.</long_description>

<short_description>A university offers young men of good standing the finest of educations and the chance to study with the greatest minds of the age.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is vital for those who wish to enter the professions, or make their way in government using talent alone. A good, well-trained brain is an excellent substitute for birth and social connections. A young gentleman’s studies can be wide ranging, and need not be tied to any particular faculty or subject area – an awarded degree or doctorate is proof enough of intellectual achievement.\n\nHistorically, in Europe at least, the established church controlled most universities, either through paying for them or by laws requiring the tutors to take holy orders. Sir Isaac Newton was very unusual in that he didn’t take orders when he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge (a post currently held by Stephen Hawking), arguing that the post required the holder to spend time on science, not the Anglican Church. However, the requirement for teachers to accept Church doctrine did mean that universities had a socially conservative outlook. While scholarships were available, students had to have money to attend, reinforcing this conservatism. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it worked did emerge from universities, the institutions were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.</long_description>

<key>vineyards_european</key>
<short_description>A vineyard is a farm dedicated to the growing of grapes and the production of wine, but on a relatively small scale. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWine is one of the pleasures of life for all classes in society and, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities. No one actually cares about the public health implications of wells and open sewers in close proximity to each other!\n\nThe patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret” (Bordeaux wine) dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Much of the earliest “New World” wine is supposedly the result of plantings by the Catholic Church to ensure that they had a supply of wine for Mass. Grape varieties can have similar odd origins: Shiraz, for example, started as Syrah grapes, originating in Persia and were brought back to France around the time of the Crusades. There were many more local grape varieties than today, because pests from America wiped out older types in the 19th Century.</long_description>

<short_description>An artillery fort is a permanent defensive structure, mounting as many heavy guns as the builders can afford to emplace. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has strong walls and parapets with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. Properly served and loaded with grape or canister shot, guns turn the approaches to the fort into death traps for any attacking infantry.\n\nThe fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and by the recoil of its own pieces. Repeated firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on the structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.\n\nHistorically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion.</long_description>

<short_description>A wine estate represents a substantial investment in vines, land and time. Wine is lovingly produced, carefully aged, and sold on at a premium. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe entire process is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood. \n\nIn some parts of the world, a great wine estate is a prestigious possession, over and above its economic value. \n\nAnd the value could be great indeed: the 18th Century was a time of prodigious boozing in Europe. Georgian Englishmen, for example, apparently had bottomless gullets even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, excessive drinking was not the cause of gout (an agonising inflammation of the joints) only a contributory factor. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet (as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period), and the liberal use of toxic lead compounds to sweeten wine probably did little to help matters!</long_description>

<short_description>A winery takes the product of several vineyards and produces wine on a large scale, shipping much of it in casks to distant markets. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGlass is expensive, and it is better to ship casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!\n\nThe 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common – whitening flour with chalk, for example – and wine was no exception. Watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as the alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without legislation to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners adding whatever they wanted to wine.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has a strong wall and parapet that is set with embrasures, gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. \n\nThe repeated firing of even quite small artillery pieces, even six-pounders, puts a tremendous strain on any structure. An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. \n\nA wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force. Its imposing walls also give notice that its builders intend to keep the land they have occupied.</long_description>

<short_description>A wooden fort is a substantial defensive work, built from logs and with supporting earthworks.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs a defensive work, it is well able to withstand enemy attacks when properly defended by stalwart men; a garrison should expect to hold out against attacks for some little time. The walls are high enough to give a good firing position to any defenders, and any aggressor had better bring a ladder or particularly acrobatic attackers to a siege! The walls are only the most visible part of the defence: the surrounding trees and undergrowth are cut back to provide a clear firing – and therefore killing – ground for the defenders. This cleared ground often extends well beyond musket range, to deny attackers the chance to approach unseen.\n\nUnlike a stockade, a fort is a relative permanent structure and, as such, it serves to mark ownership of territory as much as to command the surrounding area. Forts are positioned with an eye to using the existing terrain, commanding any strategic approaches (such as passes and river crossings) and intimidating the natives.</long_description>

<short_description>This establishment provides higher education to any who desire instruction in religious matters and for those seeking positions of authority. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe syllabus concentrates on traditional Islamic areas of study, and emphases the philosophical underpinnings of faith, the theological and spiritual orthodoxies, and the legal implications of following the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The result is a highly educated man, who can act as a scholar in the wider community, but has the intellectual and practical abilities needed to hold many government positions. The graduates of a yüksekokul can be relied upon to carry out their duties with diligence.\n\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire relied almost entirely upon its Muslim population for administrators at every level. Minority religions were granted legal protections and treated leniently, but it was almost unheard of for a professed Christian or Jew to reach a position of high authority. Although education was valued, the janissaries did have something of a military stranglehold on the administration of the Empire. Inherently resistant to change, the janissary administrators were a deadening force in the intellectual, political and scientific life of the Empire.</long_description>

<short_description>The Church has always needed educated men to fill its ranks. It is also important to teach the True Faith to the children of the wealthy.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn a time when basic education is not a right but a bought-and-paid-for privilege, the education provided by Church schools is often very good, as well as being the only option. There is, of course, a Scriptural emphasis in what is taught, but the sons of merchants, nobles and the wealthy can gain a good grounding for life and, possibly, further education. A few gifted pupils may be offered charitable scholarships, but these are few and the recipients are never permitted to forget that they should be showing appropriate gratitude. Patronage must always be appreciated!\n\nHistorically, learning had been the preserve of the established Church in many countries. A priest was both tutor and confessor in many communities and households. It also made sense for the Church to control access to education, for that way heresy and dissent could be stamped out early. For non-conformist preachers, offering education to paying clients was also a way of subsidizing their meagre income and spreading the Word of the Lord in the process.</long_description>

<short_description>This Catholic establishment educates those hoping to join the priesthood, making sure that their instruction is firmly rooted in Church dogma.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe syllabus concentrates on giving students the theological, spiritual and philosophical tools needed to carry out their duties, as well as a solid “Classical” education to produce men who will be well-respected members of society. Where science and the natural world are touched upon, it is always with an emphasis on how they reveal God’s grand plan of creation. A seminary is not intended to produce an enquiring mind, only a very disciplined one.\n\nHistorically, the seminary system owes its existence to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, a movement that aimed to defeat the heretical, Protestant views of Martin Luther and his ilk. The Council of Trent had recognised education as a weapon in its struggles against schism. The Church required an educated and intelligent group of priests, who could argue successfully in its defence. While the 18th Century is seen as the “age of Enlightenment”, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had yet to play themselves out completely and the Church’s place in the hearts of men, affairs of state and God’s universe was still open to argument. In parts of Europe, the Catholic Church was still a tremendous force for social, political and scientific conservatism.</long_description>

<short_description>The Catholic Church has educated the Spanish social elite for many centuries, and a theological college provides an excellent conservative education.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese colleges give Catholic students a good grounding in many disciplines, as well as making sure that their faith is certain. A few pupils receive scholarships or charity, but the majority of them are the children of the upper reaches of society. Many great Spaniards have been given an unshakeable belief in Spanish greatness, and the intellectual tools to attempt the task. Catholic colleges have an essentially conservative bent, and exist to support the existing political and social order, not make students question the status quo. \n\nDuring the Peninsular War, the Catholic Church held great power in Spain. Teachers needed to take religious oaths before they were even allowed to teach, ensuring that there were no dangerous firebrands waiting to instil heretical thoughts in their pupils. Before the war, in France, Church property was seized and the authority of the Pope curbed. Mindful of the Church’s power, Napoleon sought reconciliation through a Concordat in 1801. This affirmed Catholicism as the majority religion of France and made the Sabbath a holiday once more. Such changes were seen as only posturing by the faithful of Spain.</long_description>

<short_description>Places of secrecy, member&apos;s clubs help generate spies and provocateurs, as well as improving the happiness of all social classes.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA member&apos;s club is a sanctuary, a place to escape everyday life and spend some time with like-minded fellows. They are also quiet, private places, where secrets can be shared and deals done out of sight of others. They are, in fact, breeding grounds for intrigue, gossip, and double-dealing, making them the perfect breeding ground for unsavoury spies and provocateurs.\n\nHistorically, member&apos;s clubs first appeared in London towards the end of the 18th century. They were highly exclusive in their early years and provided the upper classes with somewhere to gamble, technically an illegal pastime. However, gambling was the least of many evils practised in these clubs. Perhaps the most infamous of these societies was the Hellfire Club, originally established in London in 1719 by the Duke of Wharton, simply for the purposes of debauchery. In 1735, the Irish Hellfire Club was established, and went on to outdo its predecessor in as many foul ways as possible. These included paying defrocked priests to perform mock Catholic masses, sacrificing cats to Satan and, allegedly, on one occasion offering up a dwarf in a diabolic sacrifice. To this day, no one is entirely sure why a dwarf was considered appropriate.</long_description>

<short_description>Shh! It’s a secret!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe business of secret societies is, well, secret. What goes on behind their closed doors and in hidden chambers is a mystery, wrapped in misdirection and cloaked in falsehood. This building supports a number of spies and provocateurs, and increases the chance that they may be produced each turn. It also has a positive effect on the happiness of all classes: who knows who might be watching, or listening? Surely it is better to be happy than attract unwelcome attention with frowns!\n\nSecret societies have always attracted a good deal of attention because of their secrecy, and many have been accused of conspiracies to do everything, from running a single country to running the whole world. Thanks to the secrecy of the Masons, they have often been suspected of many nefarious activities. A typical “secret” society founded in the early 19th Century is American: the “Skull and Bones Society”, set up by Yale University students. Its secrecy probably owed more to a desire not to have parents and university officials know just how much drinking was going on, but in recent years it has been the subject of many conspiracy theories. In 2007 the American CIA felt it necessary to deny rumours that it owed its establishment to a cabal of Skull and Bones members!</long_description>

<short_description>A lodge improves the happiness of all and increases the chance that a spy or provocateur will be created.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA Masonic lodge is an ideal meeting place for like-minded people to discuss many important and secret matters. Although primarily for the upper and middle classes, a Masonic lodge does improve the happiness of the lower classes. Perhaps they are pleased that their betters are too busy to be regularly horsewhipping them for impudence…\n\nThe first Grand Lodge of the Freemasons was established in England in 1717, when four lodges came together at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St Paul’s churchyard. Just a few years later in 1723 James Anderson wrote ‘The Constitutions of the Free-masons’, and laid out the rules by which the fraternity would be governed. In this document he traced the history of “the craft” all the way back to the Old Testament. Whatever its origins, Masonry spread across Europe with some rapidity during the Age of the Enlightenment, prompting warnings from the Catholic Church and suspicion from both revolutionaries and arch-conservatives.</long_description>

<short_description>Each turn a college may produce a gentleman, and it always helps with research into new technologies. It is also used to promote Bonapartist doctrine.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA college offers an academic education, perhaps a veneer of sophistication, to the sons of the aristocracy, the gentry, and the merchant classes. It may also, unintentionally, expose these people to the dangerous concept of thinking about the world, and that can create a wish for reform, if the world’s many injustices are considered.\n\nHistorically, a college education usually required substantial wealth, as there were scholarships or charitable places for the talented poor. Although science and philosophy were on the curriculum, the ideas taught were usually socially and politically conservative rather than radical. College masters were unlikely to see any reasons for upsetting the wealthy parents of their scholars, and most students saw no reason to question their entrenched privileges. Radicalism was confined to a small number of students, or came out in rebellious and extremely bad behaviour involving local taverns, bawdyhouses, and “actresses”. Rebellion could always be curbed by a dose of the pox, or a threat from father to cut off an allowance!</long_description>

<key>tEducation2_university_spain</key>
<short_description>This is a bastion of learning and academic thought, where the arts, theology and sciences are carefully taught. It is also used to promote Bonapartist doctrine.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA university offers young men from good families a fine education, and the chance to study the greatest achievements of mankind. As a result there is a chance that, each turn, this university may produce a gentleman, a useful agent for his nation. The faculty also aids research into new technologies, but may produce a wish for reform among the people; even though the university is socially conservative, it cannot keep all progressive thoughts away from its students.\n\nA good education was useful for those who wished to make their way in the world using talent as well as family connections. A young gentleman’s studies were wide ranging, and not tied to any particular subject area: an awarded degree or doctorate was proof enough of some intellectual achievement. Historically, the established church in many countries had established the universities, and continued to run them. This meant that the university as a body rarely challenged the established order of things; the teachers and students both had vested interests in the status quo. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it should work did emerge, the universities were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.</long_description>

<short_description>This is a centre of learning and original thought, where the science and art are given free rein. It is also used to promote Bonapartist doctrine.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEach turn, a modern university has a very good chance of producing a gentleman, and it also significantly aids technology research in the region. The liberal thinking that occurs greatly improves the region&apos;s happiness, but also creates a strong desire for reform among the people. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the all the studies undertaken, along with personal pride and ambition. Ideas, however, are not confined to the intellectual elite, but passed on to everyone who can understand: learning inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen.\n\nThe French Revolution was not always kind to scientists. On the one hand, Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) did not suffer greatly and was not forced out of the country on account of his Italian birth; Napoleon later named him as one of the Légion d&apos;honneur. On the other hand, Antoine Lavoisier (1743-94), a man rightly hailed as the father of modern chemistry was, in the space of a single day, tried, condemned, and executed on trumped-up charges. His involvement in tax farming possibly counted against him, but in killing Lavoisier, a political liberal as well as a genius, France lost one of the greatest minds of all time.</long_description>

<short_description>A supply port improves the flow of goods and supplies into a region. It also allows some smaller ships to be constructed.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMoving military supplies by land is difficult and expensive; most roads are simply terrible! Anything that has to be moved more than a few miles goes by water whenever possible. A supply port lets a nation moves goods to where they are needed with a fair degree of efficiency. Military supplies go out, and goods from trading posts arrive from across the world.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the British had the most powerful navy in the world as a virtuous circle of sea trade funded its existence, and a strong navy allowed even more trade. The new “industrial revolution” meant that manufactured goods were there to be traded across the world. Trade was important because it allowed Britain to finance wars as well as fight them. Allies could be supported with gold rather than men in the field. This was what prompted Bonaparte’s Continental System of blockading British trade. It didn’t work terribly well, but Napoleon knew that the way to beat Britain was to starve the country of money.</long_description>

<short_description>This port decreases recruitment costs, increases the number of units that can be garrisoned, and increases military supplies received from trade posts.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWell organised supplies are of the utmost importance in war. Troops have all the weapons and support they need, when needed. A military supply port not only improves the capacity of a port to move material to and from armies and trade posts, it also reduces recruitment costs, increases the available space for a garrison and enables the construction of better ships.\n\nHistorically, the Royal Navy knew the importance of securing their own supplies and limiting those of the enemy. Often raiding parties were sent ashore to destroy naval timber stock, and in particular masts, stored in enemy yards. Destroying timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to repair. Burning war materials rather than stealing them must have gone against the natural, and slightly piratical, inclinations of many officers and seamen: their prize money was going up in smoke!</long_description>

<short_description>A military port complex improves trade, especially in military goods, aids the construction of ships and supports military operations in a region.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe port is a place of bustle, business and excitement. Goods and military supplies are likely to be stacked in apparently random profusion, while clerks and shipping agents argue about manifests, shipping prices and delivery details. The apparent disorder is, however, deceptive, for everyone knows exactly where everything is and where everything should be going. Shipping goods and supplies by sea is well understood, but carrying them on roads is a slow and painful affair, thanks to the poor quality of many roads.\n\nBy the Napoleonic times, navies were well practiced in running shore establishments. The division between commercial and military ports was there, but not considered important when getting supplies shipped across the sea. What mattered more to the port authorities was the “shrinkage” of goods disappearing as dock workers helped themselves, and the need to keep rough booze and cheap floozies away from ship’s crews for as long as possible. A port admiral would spend a good deal of effort on what might be termed public order every time a fleet arrived and needed unloading!</long_description>

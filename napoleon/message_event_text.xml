<text>Thanks to your efforts, the Jamestown settlement has prospered! No longer reliant on food from England, the settlers can start amassing wealth and expanding Britain’s colonies in America.\n\nThe Jamestown settlement has made a good start, but complacency is a dangerous thing. As word of the successful colonisation of the New World spreads, more people arrive from the Old World. Other European nations have taken note of your success. They too are looking to the New World with a view to possible expansion of their own interests. Although vast, these American lands are not endless. Confrontation is inevitable.</text>

<text>The French are defeated! You can claim a decisive victory for Britain over her long-standing enemy. The British now control North America, giving them the valuable resources of the Ohio Valley.\n\nBut this time of peace may be short lived. Britain’s policies in America are seen as overbearing and repressive by the colonists. Excessive taxes and restrictions on expansion have left the American people longing for freedom, not British rule. If this situation continues, the Thirteen Colonies will be forced into open warfare to win the right of self government.</text>

<text>Free Americans have thrown off their chains, and driven out their tyrannical British oppressors! At last, America is the Land of the Free, as well as the Home of the Brave. The remaining British troops leave American shores by the shipload and American independence has been fully, if reluctantly, accepted in London.\n\nWithout your efforts, none of this would have been possible. America would remain in the hands of the British. Your careful planning and well-timed aggression have brought Americans to a new dawn. The dark night of British rule is at an end. The bright dawn of a united America lies ahead.</text>

Given our long-standing contention, however, it can only be a matter of time before we find ourselves faced with fresh hostilities from the Austrians…\n\n</text>

<text>Success! Our propagation of anti-French sentiment is gaining momentum and the influence of French deception upon the Spanish people is diminishing with each passing day. In recognition of our commitment to ousting the French from the peninsula, a Spanish guerrillero has joined our forces in Beira, eager to do his part in fighting the common enemy.</text>

<text>Order has been restored, at least for the time being. We must not rest upon our laurels, however; dissidents are everywhere, and enemy agents will stop at nothing to incite the locals to resist us. Nonetheless, our efforts have stirred our Catalonian supporters into taking action against the absolutist regime that has dictated the Spanish way of life for so many years. In light of this, a local provocateur has offered his services for the good of the Empire.</text>

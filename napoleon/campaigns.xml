<description>Napoleon Bonaparte and his Armée d&apos;Orient are faced with a difficult task: the conquest of Egypt and a march to India. Once in India, they will join forces with Tippu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, and drive the hated English into the sea! Such is the grandeur of the scheme and, in General Napoleon Bonaparte, there is a commander of equal grandeur to undertake it.\n\nBefore this can be achieved, however, there are more immediate obstacles. Egypt is ruled by the Mamelukes, who are nominally loyal servants of the Ottoman Empire. In the burning heat of the desert, Frenchmen must march on Alexandria and break their power before anything else can be achieved. But here, in this land of ancient secrets, there is glory to be won!\n\nGlory enough for France, and glory enough, possibly, for General Bonaparte!</description>

<description>Behind all the Imperial façade and republican sentiments, France is once again an absolute monarchy, now ruled by Emperor Napoleon I. His efforts to secure good marriages for his brothers and marshals are dynastic politics that Bourbon kings would have grasped instantly. Yet, for all this, the French people have freedom, as Napoleon has used credit gained by his victories to remake France. Merit, as well as birth, now counts for something.\n\nThe Emperor’s efforts have given France an impressive empire and domination over many neighbours; he is a source of strength. Napoleon has redrawn the map of Europe to suit his own ends. He is also a great weakness, as his treatment of enemies and rivals has not been entirely politic or polite. He has caused offence to nearly everyone, taking not giving, even when he should have been conciliatory. He has managed, through poor diplomacy, to make the British look like attractive allies to many.\n\nAs a result, the Austrians are waiting for an opportunity to strike back at France for their recent humiliations and losses. The Russians, too, will strike down this new upstart emperor if given a chance, and will they ignore Napoleon’s instructions to ban trade with England? The Prussians, apparently, are content to sit and wait, but for how long? Will they idly sit by if it becomes necessary to extend French power in northern Germany? And then there are the British: always there are the British. That vindictive little island will have to be dealt with at some time.\n\nFrance, therefore, faces many rivals. But if they can be isolated and removed one by one, then Europe really will know peace, under Bonaparte, the heir to Caesar!</description>

<description>The new, revolutionary Republic of France is under threat from all the old reactionary nations of Europe! It is clear that there are no options other than war, and that the utter ruination of France is the only aim of Austria and France’s other enemies. The Austrians are motivated by fear: they fear their own people will follow the same revolutionary path.\n\nThe Austrians can be confronted in Germany and northern Italy. Austria’s possessions in Italy are ready for liberation! The other states of Italy bear watching, but should not be able to stand against the righteous anger of the French people!\n\nGeneral “Napoleone di Buonaparte”, in charge of the Army of Italy’s artillery, has been appointed to command the entire army. It is his duty to hold onto France’s territory in the Italian peninsular. This is, however, an ambitious and skilful man and he has plans to drive the Austrians out of Italy and back to the gates of Vienna.</description>

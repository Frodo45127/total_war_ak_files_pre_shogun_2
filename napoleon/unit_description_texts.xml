<description_text>This is the smallest vessel styled a “ship-of-the-line” of battle, carrying some 50 long guns.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nShips-of-the-line are the mainstay of fighting fleets; they are strong and stable gun platforms for battering enemy fleets to pieces. A 50-gun ship-of-the-line is a square-rigged, two-deck vessel, carrying two calibres of cannon: 24- and 18-pounders, with the heavier guns mounted on the lower deck. Though cheap compared to other two-deck warships, their broadside is still effective at close range, and best employed against frigates and smaller craft. A 50-gun ship should not be expected to last long in combat against larger battleships.\n\nBy the 1750s it was obvious that 50-gun ships lacked the hull strength and firepower to stand in the line of battle against larger vessels. Because of their size, there was a new production of British 50-gun ships to serve in shallow coastal waters during the American Revolution but, apart from this, their usefulness in battle was largely over. Various national admiralties removed these small battle ships from active service, or sent them to minor overseas stations where they were unlikely to encounter powerful enemies. Some survived as converted troop transports.</long_description_text>

<key>2_Decker_64</key>
<description_text>The 64-gun ship-of-the-line can hold its own in battle, but is cheaper to build and run than heavier ships.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe 64-gun ship may lack some of the firepower of the other ships-of-the-line, but it still has a respectable broadside, and can be constructed at a lower cost. It can be regarded as a stepping stone between 50- and 74-gun ships, with more broadside weight than the first yet with a faster reloading time than the second thanks to its lighter cannons. Opinions differ as to whether this is a happy compromise.\n\nThe Royal Navy classed a 64-gun ship as a “third rate” ship, normally a classification reserved for 74-gun ships. Although small, the 64 was not without supporters: Captain Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship was HMS Agamemnon, a 64 built at Bucklers Hard in the New Forest. His crew, often called Agamemnons, loyally followed Nelson to his subsequent ships and successes. The Agamemnon itself was used by the Royal Navy during the American and French Revolutionary Wars, the Napoleonic War and was at the Battle of Trafalgar. After nearly 30 years of hard service it ran aground off South America, but the entire crew survived the wreck. The &quot;Eggs and Bacon&quot;, as the crew called it, looked after its men to the last.</long_description_text>

<key>2_Decker_74</key>
<description_text>The 74-gun ship is an excellent blend of firepower and handling. It is a stable gun platform and has more guns than many armies!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe 74 is a supremely practical naval weapon and regarded as the best balance between defensive strength and manoeuvrability. A two-deck design, it is strong enough to mount very heavy 32-pounder cannons on its lower gun deck. These, when combined with the upper deck’s 18-pounders, give it a devastating broadside, although this is best delivered at close quarters.\n\nThe French developed the 74-gun ship concept in the mid-18th Century. The design was so good that other navies lost no time in copying it for themselves or taking French ships in action. Many French vessels were made from green timber that “worked” in heavy seas and therefore leaked; the French accepted this because they believed the green timber made the ships resilient. British 74s were well built too, although there was a regrettable tendency to save money by recycling timbers, along with their woodworm and rot, from older vessels!\n\nThe last 74, HMS Implacable, was finally scuttled in 1949! Built in 1800 by the French, and then captured by the British at Trafalgar in 1805, she stayed in active service until 1842. She ended her days as a coal hulk.</long_description_text>

<key>2_Decker_80</key>
<description_text>This is a heavily-armed vessel, with a destructive close range broadside and a very strong hull to withstand return fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese large two-decker ships-of-the-line can hold more and heavier guns than most two-deck vessels. They carry 32- and 24-pounders. These powerful cannon do not have the fast reloading times of lighter pieces, but make up for that with weight of shot. It is most advantageous for a captain to hold his fire until close to the enemy, in order to do the maximum possible damage.\n\nHistorically, the “new pattern” 80-gun ship with two decks was considered a success. The previous three-deck 80s had been somewhat unwieldy in action. In 1758, the French 80-gun Foudroyant fought an action against HMS Monmouth (66 guns, third rate) off Cartagena in Spain. The fight lasted for over four hours, and only came to an end when HMS Swiftsure (70 guns, third rate) joined the battle. Foudroyant was captured. Once brought back to England, Foudroyant was refitted and repaired. In a further upset for the French, in 1782 HMS Foudroyant captured another French ship, the Pégase, earning her then-captain, John Jervis, a knighthood for the feat.</long_description_text>

<key>2_Decker_HMS_Elephant</key>
<description_text>HMS Elephant is a ship of the line with an impressive broadside at close range.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike all ships-of-the-line, HMS Elephant is not a handy ship, being slow and unresponsive to the helm. Good sailing qualities, however, are secondary to the weight of broadside that she can both deliver and withstand. This is important in a warship that is intended to form the centrepiece of any squadron and possibly act as an admiral’s flagship.\n\nBuilt on the River Hamble in Hampshire, an estuary with a centuries-old shipbuilding industry, HMS Elephant was one of a class of 12 third-rate, 74-gun warships. The class was designed by Sir Thomas Slade, possibly the best naval architect of his time, and most were built by private contractors using standardised plans. HMS Elephant was chosen by Vice-Admiral Nelson to be his squadron flagship at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801), thanks to her shallow draft, which was considered a useful feature when attacking a fleet at anchor. Another Slade-designed ship, HMS Victory, carried the promoted Viscount Nelson to his final victory and death at Trafalgar in 1805.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A 106-gun ship-of-the-line has an impressive array of guns and is intended to be the centrepiece of a fleet.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhile these warships are among the most powerful vessels afloat, they are lubberly sailors, being both slow and unresponsive. This is not a serious shortcoming because, armed with 106 cannons firing 32-, 24-, and 18-pounder balls on their three decks, they deliver a terrible and destructive broadside. They actually have more artillery than most land armies! Their cost, however, is a drawback and few navies can afford to build or maintain more than a handful of them.\n\nHistorically, 106-gun ships-of-the-line were never common, and hardly ever sent to overseas stations. They were pure battleships, existing only to fight in set-piece actions, and not for mundane duties such as protecting merchantmen, policing the seas and hunting down privateers. They were commissioned and richly decorated as a physical representation of the glory of the state, but this practice went into decline as warfare became more intense, forcing ships to become more functional.</long_description_text>

<key>3_Decker_86</key>
<description_text>This 86-gun ship has a strong hull capable of withstanding heavy broadsides. It excels against other ships of the line.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis three-deck warship is a design compromise between wanting the firepower of a “first rate” battleship with the sea-keeping qualities of a 74-gun ship. Like many compromises, the result is not perfect, but the extra weight of fire in the broadside does compensate for poor sailing qualities. The design does have one unexpected benefit: enemy captains are often quick to identify this ship as a much larger vessel and run from a superior enemy!\n\nThe lower gun deck houses 32-pounders, and this explains the “tumblehome” shape: the bulge at water level and just above in the hull allows more room on the lower decks for the recoil of large cannons. Lighter guns on the higher decks did not recoil to the same extent.\n\nHistorically, only the British Royal Navy commissioned ships of this “second rate” class; other nations built large “first rates” instead. This was probably due to the Royal Navy’s need for large ships to act as flagships on foreign stations, an assignment that would have been wasteful and expensive for a very large ship. The second rate did retain some of the more favourable qualities of a first rate, including a robust hull. During the Battle of Cape Saint Vincent (1780) HMS Blenheim fought the Santissima Trinidad and took 105 hits to the hull, but only 13 crew members were killed and 48 wounded.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A 98-gun second rate ship-of-the-line is an over-gunned standard design: a powerful addition to any fleet.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis three-deck warship is a modified “second rate” ship, and the addition of extra guns alters the balance of the vessel and consequently its handling. While a normal second rate is somewhat lumbering, this ship is even less handy and responsive to the helm. The benefits in terms of additional firepower do, however, handsomely compensate for a loss of manoeuvrability.\n\nHistorically, the 98-gun ship was created by simply adding extra guns to the quarterdeck and increasing the weight of some of the other cannon. However, few nations chose to commission original ships of this type, preferring to build normal “first rates” instead. Only the Royal Navy bothered, as it needed large ships to act as flagships on overseas postings. Nine 98-gun ships were ordered during the French Revolutionary Wars, including HMS Boyne and HMS Union, both ship names emphasising loyalty to the British Crown.</long_description_text>

<key>3_Decker_British_Heavy_1st_Rate</key>
<description_text>This costly, massive and powerful vessel carries 122 heavy guns, and has a hull capable of withstanding heavy broadsides.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike most large ships-of-the-line, this vessel is a terrifying sight for enemies and with good reason: its broadside is enormous. Each side of the ship, let alone the whole thing, has more guns than many land armies can boast! Such firepower, however, makes the ship heavy and cumbersome under sail. This is little comfort to those caught by its broadside. Equally, the price of the vessel and its high upkeep costs are little comfort to enemies either.\n\nHistorically, ships as large and heavily protected as this over-sized first rate were incredibly expensive to maintain and required a large crew. They were often used as admiral’s flagships, as there was plenty of room for the admiral and his staff. The term flagship originates from the officers&apos; custom of hanging distinctive pennants to denote their presence. These flags were often rather large: Lord Howe’s Union flag for use aboard his Royal Navy ship was 12-by-17 feet in size.</long_description_text>

<description_text>This floating behemoth has 130 guns on her four decks, making her the largest and most powerful ship in the world!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Santissima Trinidad is, however, an unwieldy beast and hardly responsive to the helm. This, however, is entirely secondary to the enormous firepower that her captain has at his command. There is no ship in the world to rival her and few that even bear comparison.\n\nBuilt in Havana in 1769, the Santissima Trinidad was the pride of the Spanish navy. Although a masterpiece of contemporary construction techniques, she was built to a very old-fashioned design principle. Most naval architects were beginning to realise that overall functionality was more important than size and firepower, but this ship harked back to a time when a hefty broadside was the only consideration. It was obvious to many experienced Spanish officers that her power lay in defence, but this was overlooked and she was put to sea with the fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). She lost her sails under heavy fire from the British ships and was eventually forced to surrender, crippled and unable to bring her guns to bear, by HMS Neptune. Unfortunately, she was lost at sea during a storm after the battle.</long_description_text>

<key>Art_Fix_Ottoman_Bombardment_Mortars</key>
<description_text>A mortar is a large calibre, fixed artillery piece that lobs percussive shells and quicklime in a high arc at the enemy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTo the uneducated eye, a mortar looks like a large, stumpy cooking pot, set at an angle in a heavy wooden frame. Indeed, the weapon’s name may even come from its similarity to the mortars used to grind spices. Mortars use indirect fire, firing their percussive shells and quicklime high into the air to plunge down on enemy positions.\n\nUnlike a howitzer, a mortar uses a fixed, and relatively small, charge of gunpowder to propel its shell. Range is adjusted by changing the angle of fire; accuracy is subject to winds and weather. There is also a practical minimum range to mortar fire as the weapon cannot be aimed in a near-vertical position. The men that handle them are incredibly vulnerable to fast moving cavalry.\n\nModern mortars owe their widespread use to trench warfare in the First World War. Current designs, based on the British Stokes trench mortar, come in many sizes. Most can fire shells with proximity fuses as anti-personnel rounds. The larger examples can fire sophisticated “smart” munitions that guide themselves onto targets.</long_description_text>

<description_text>War rockets are a terrifying device; they can be fired over a great distance and lower enemy morale.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe rockets these troops employ are iron tubes filled with gunpowder propellant; when fired in large volleys, the noise alone is unnerving and has a negative effect on enemy morale. Each rocket is laid in an angled launcher, and it is the job of the artilleryman to correctly judge the angle of launch so that the rockets drop in the middle of the enemy. He also needs to take into account wind, as the long tails of the rockets make them inaccurate. The fixed nature of this artillery means the crewmen are incredibly vulnerable to attack, especially from fast moving cavalry.\n\nHistorically, it was the Indian war rockets used by Tippu Sultan of Mysore that introduced Europeans to rocket bombardment. The British copied these weapons as the Congreve rocket system, and used them aboard ships as well as on land. A rocket troop was present at the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, although accounts of their effectiveness vary. Congreve’s system even included illumination rounds to light up the battlefield!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Foot artillery batteries are the core of an army on campaign: cannons win battles.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDespite the name, foot artillery batteries are towed by horses. The artillerymen, however, march alongside their pieces rather than ride. Because the guns can be loaded with round or canister shot they are effective at long and short range: canister shot turns cannons into gigantic fowling pieces. Artillery is slower than the rest of the army and, if left behind and undefended, will be vulnerable to cavalry attacks. Disabling the enemy’s guns should always be a high priority for a general, and artillerymen only have the most rudimentary sword skills for their defence.\n\nBy the late eighteenth century, improvements in artillery design had drastically reduced the weight of cannons and their field carriages. Design improvements had reduced the time to get into action from the march. By carefully positioning the barrel in the centre of the gun carriage, the balance, and manoeuvrability of guns was significantly improved. Napoleon was an artilleryman, and his use of guns in concentration against small parts of the enemy battle line persuaded many nations to increase the size of their own artillery corps.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Howitzers send shells high into the air to plunge onto enemies, making defences and cover less effective.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHowitzers fall somewhere between guns and mortars, the other main artillery types. Like guns, they have limited mobility and are slow moving, but are they not as accurate as cannons. They do not fire straight at the target, but lob shots high into the air to plunge down on a target. The charge of powder and the barrel angle can be varied, which means a howitzer can send an almost-vertical shot over a wall. Given such an ability, they are best employed to bombard areas where enemies are concentrated. In close action, they can fire canister rounds directly into enemy formations, blasting them with hundreds of musket balls.\n\nHistorically, howitzers were not easy to use. Ballistics was not a perfectly understood science and, apart from inaccurate targeting, a shell did not necessarily do any damage when it arrived. Erratic winds could send shells flying off course. Shell fuses had to be lit while still in the barrel, and the length of fuse judged to match the flight time. If the fuse was too short, the shell could explode in mid air; too long and the enemy might be able to put it out before the shell exploded!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Accurate and capable of firing over breathtaking distances, the Artillerie à Pied is a powerful artillery unit.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis elite unit is precise and deadly, but it does have the disadvantage of being vulnerable to fast moving cavalry and melee attacks. The soldiers who man these guns, although armed with swords, are not trained to defend themselves effectively. The power here lies in the cannons, and placing them at a discreet distance from the fray is always advisable.\n\nFormed in 1808, the Artillerie à Pied consisted of six companies of gunners and a company of ouvriers-pontonniers. These ouvriers-pontonniers were responsible for building bridges, allowing the artillery to pass swiftly and safely to their positions. There was some argument amongst the engineers and the artillery over who had command of these men but it was eventually decided that they should be assigned to the artillery. Ouvriers-pontonniers could construct a bridge of sixty to eighty pontoons, some 500 feet or 150 metres long, in just seven hours. They were also known to improvise if supplies were short, creating bridges from any materials that were to hand.</long_description_text>

<description_text>This numerically strong gun battery is a very powerful artillery force for any French commander.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWith twice as many guns as an ordinary artillery unit, the Grand Battery is an exceptionally strong unit. Its cannons have both a long range and tremendous killing power. However, it is vulnerable to cavalry attack even when not emplaced, as it is slow moving. The gun crews are only armed with swords and relatively untrained in hand-to-hand combat. Fighting is not their task: serving the guns is their only duty.\n\nThe Grand Battery was the turning point of Napoleon Bonaparte’s career: he was promoted to brigadier-general thanks to his skills and drive. As a trained artillerist, he knew that the real killing power in an army was in the heavy guns, not musketry or sabres. The idea of a Grand Battery was used in many of his later battles. It relied on weight of fire against a single section of an enemy line to blow a hole through any enemy defences. Against the storm of shot that a grand battery could produce, flesh stood little chance. The best defence was to use a reverse slope and hide behind the crest of a hill, rather than endure such a bombardment.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Powerful and deadly accurate, this unit can achieve devastating amounts of damage from a considerable distance.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis elite artillery unit is capable causing a swathe of devastation and chaos in the enemy. Though very precise, it does have the disadvantage of being vulnerable to fast moving cavalry and melee attacks. The soldiers who man these guns should not be expected to defend themselves in melee for very long: they are gunners, not warriors. Their power lies in the cannons, so placing them at a safe distance from the fray is advisable.\n\nHistorically, the French army owed the success of its artillery to Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The son of a magistrate, he entered the French Royal Artillery as a volunteer, and quickly rose through the ranks. After becoming lieutenant-general and commander of the order of St Louis in 1765, he fell out of favour with the royal court and only returned in 1776, when he obtained the position of first inspector of artillery. It was during this time that he began a series of reforms that revolutionised French cannon production. His Gribeauval System of standardised components was adopted by other nations, including the United States.</long_description_text>

<key>Art_Foot_Russian_10_lber_Unicorn</key>
<description_text>Wonderfully versatile and breathtakingly powerful, the unicorn is the crowning achievement of Russian artillery.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis impressive piece of artillery, named for the unicorn traditionally engraved on the barrel, has fantastic range capabilities and fires a wide array of shot types. A howitzer and cannon hybrid, the unicorn is operated by skilled artillerymen who, although expertly trained in the firing of cannons, lack skills required for effective defence in melee. However, the power and versatility of the unicorn guns on the battlefield more than make up for this weakness.\n\nThe first unicorn was cast by Andrey Chokhov, a Russian gun founder who began his career during the reign of Ivan the Terrible (1547-84). He supervised the creation of many of Russia’s most famous artillery pieces including the behemoth “Tsar Pushka”, or Tsar Cannon. This masterpiece was commissioned by Tsar Feodor and weighed a whopping 38 metric tons. It originally sat on a wooden carriage that was later destroyed during Napoleon’s attack on Moscow in 1812. It now sits in the Kremlin next to the “Tsar Bell”, the biggest bell ever made but never rung.</long_description_text>

<description_text>To keep up with fast moving cavalry, horse artillery batteries put entire gun crews on horseback or the horse-drawn limbers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe cannon used by horse artillery lack range and firepower compared to other artillery pieces. This is considered unimportant; speed is all! Horse artillery units can move guns to a firing position, deploy, and then remove themselves with some despatch. They can be where they are needed to support and attack or break an enemy advance. They are a tactical reserve that any general will welcome, or a means to exploit a weakness in the enemy line.\n\nHistorically, Frederick the Great of Prussia observed that even the smallest artillery piece could be enough to break enemy defensive formations, leaving them open to subsequent attacks by infantry. He concluded that speed and mobility, rather than simple weight of shot, was important. This observation lead him to order the development of a ‘galloper’ gun, and a six-pounder that could be dragged at the gallop. Frederick’s contribution to military tactics was acknowledged by Napoleon himself, who considered the king a master tactician.</long_description_text>

<description_text>This elite horse artillery can gallop when limbered up, quickly bringing firepower to where it is needed.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIn horse artillery units everyone in the gun crews rides into battle: drivers ride the lead horses in teams, while gun crews sit on the gun limbers. The Artillerie à Cheval represent a good balance between speed of movement and firepower. The crews are highly experienced and disciplined, and their intimate knowledge of the guns enables them to deliver accurate, devastating shots at long range.\n\nHistorically, these men and their cannons were part of Napoleon’s Imperial Guard, and held in the highest regard by the emperor. Admittance to the Imperial Guard was extremely tough and, because only the very experienced or very good gained entry, the Guard could boast of the very best gunners in Europe. The horse artillery division was the elite within the elite, and got the best of everything. When the supply of suitable horses ran low in 1815, Napoleon ordered his Horse Grenadiers to give up their mounts to be draft animals for his beloved horse artillery.</long_description_text>

Guard artillerymen are experienced gunners and excellent horsemen. Their fire is devastating, and delivered with some urgency.\n\nHistorically, the Guard Horse Artillery was a regiment of Napoleon’s Imperial Guard, the cream of the French military. The Imperial Guard was virtually an army within the army, made up of the Old and Middle Guard, veterans from his previous campaigns, and the Young Guard, the cream of the new recruits. Admittance to the ranks was extremely tough and, because only the very best gained entry, it could also boast the very best gunners in Europe. These elite troops were a grade above the rest of the French army, and enjoyed certain privileges such as better uniforms, food and equipment. They were also carefully looked after by Napoleon, both on and off the battlefield.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These mounted men are a useful mobile force who excel at melee.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDragoon Guards are trained to fight on horseback and foot. They each carry a sabre and carbine musket but are only capable of firing when dismounted. Their slightly impetuous nature makes them less effective than other more disciplined cavalry units but their flexibility and skill in close-combat makes them incredibly valuable. Having the option to unleash these men at key strategic points on the field of battle can easily provide the upper hand over an ill-prepared enemy.\n\nDragoons were often considered to be inferior soldiers by “proper” regiments of horse: not really cavalrymen with class, but jumped-up infantry. They did not need particularly good horses because they did not fight on horseback, so they were cheaper to equip and pay than regular cavalry. In the British Army the designation “dragoon guards” was used as a face-saving measure when “real” cavalry units were converted to dragoons; despite becoming a lower class unit, they kept their slightly elitist cavalry attitudes. The British Army still has dragoon guard units and they now use light tanks in reconnaissance and security roles.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Horse Guards are an elite heavy cavalry unit, with a fierce reputation and deadly sabres.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIt is the task of the heavy cavalry to break the enemy by shock and impact. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks through weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: that is the work of faster, lighter cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and utter consternation. Thanks to being part of the royal household guard, these cavalrymen also lend a touch of class to the brutal business of a cavalry charge!\n\nHistorically, the Horse Guards Parade in London was the setting for “Trooping of the Colour”, a practice that dates back to the 17th Century. A regiment’s colours were a rallying point on the battlefield and so they were shown to the soldiers beforehand, in order that they would be recognised in battle. Today, the ceremony is used to celebrate the official birthday of the ruling monarch; at the time of writing Queen Elizabeth attends every year and takes the salute at the end of the parade.</long_description_text>

<key>Cav_Heavy_British_Horse_Guards_Uxbridge</key>
<description_text>Uxbridge is an exceptional cavalry commander, and can sway the course of a battle with his leadership.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHis presence alone is enough to inspire battle-weary troops to fight on, even in the bleakest of situations: a general who carries the respect of his troops (if not his fellow officers) is a valuable asset. Although cavalrymen lead from the front, it is advisable to keep this man away from particularly dangerous fights, for his protection if nothing else.\n\nHenry Paget, the Earl of Uxbridge, later Marquis of Anglesey, was Wellington’s cavalry commander during the 1815 Waterloo campaign. This was not a comfortable arrangement for either of them, as Paget had proved himself to be something less than a gentleman by seducing, and running off with, the wife of Wellington’s youngest brother. This social gaffe put a bit of a crimp on what had been a distinguished military career as a cavalry leader. Nobody denied that Paget was courageous and skilful, but he was a cad and a bounder. He is also the man who had his leg shot off at Waterloo in the middle of a conversation with Wellington. It is not recorded whether their dry exchange of remarks: “By God, sir, I&apos;ve lost my leg!” and “By God, sir, so you have!” was accompanied by an excusable smirk on Wellington’s behalf.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These heavy cavalrymen can be rushed to critical areas on the battlefield to provide powerful support.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhen mounted, these troops can either use their deadly heavy swords in close combat or break enemy line formations with a powerful charge. Their horses allow them to reposition quickly to counter enemy moves, quickly lending firepower to beleaguered comrades. However, they have to dismount before firing their carbines. They sometimes need to be kept on a tight rein by a commander, because their eagerness for battle can sometimes become recklessness.\n\nIn 1807, the Danes refused naval support to the British. The British, for their part, feared the Danes would support the French, and so part of the King’s German Legion marched to Denmark. On the road to Copenhagen, the 1st King’s German Light Dragoons learned that there was an arsenal in the fortress of Friederickswerk. Despite having only a single squadron to hand, Captain Krauchenberg, the dragoon’s commander, sent a message demanding the fortress’ surrender. He claimed that an army of 10,000 was on the way. His enormous fib worked, and the KGL Dragoons secured an impressive haul of enemy guns and ammunition, just as daylight revealed their actual numbers! By then, it was too late for the hapless Danes.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite cavalrymen are all gentlemen, skilled in melee attacks and deadly on the charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLife Guards are an elite court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. This doesn’t diminish their skills as soldiers: their powerful charge is capable of breaking the most stoic of enemy lines and their skill in a fight is almost unrivalled. However, their pride can lead some to be a little hot headed: they lack the discipline of other cavalry units and, like all cavalry, they may prove ineffective against infantry in square.\n\nHistorically, perhaps the oddest sounding of the various royal guard cavalry regiments were the curiously named “horse grenadier guards”. Common sense would seem to indicate that these men would only ever get to throw their grenades once, before their horses took off at speed towards all points of the compass! In British service, the Household Cavalry regiments, including the horse grenadiers did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have “corporals of horse”. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, even a private trooper, is ever a servant.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Scots Greys are a heavy dragoon unit that can also be used as effective shock cavalry.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe men of the Greys are each armed with a flintlock carbine and the standard British heavy cavalry sword, a man-killing butcher’s blade of a sword when used from horseback in close combat. Like all Scotsmen, they are sure they are the best soldiers in the world and can fight like the Devil. This may be true, but more disciplined and less impetuous cavalry can beat them.\n\nMore properly called the 2nd Royal North British Dragoons, the Scots Greys were one of the oldest dragoon regiments in British service. The term “North Britain” was preferred in official circles to “Scotland” after the Act of Union between England and Scotland, and abortive Jacobite rebellions, but the name Scots Greys was used anyway. Distinguished by their all-grey mounts, the 2nd RNBD achieved immortality as part of the Union Brigade in Uxbridge’s magnificent and successful heavy cavalry charge against the French centre at Waterloo. Sergeant Charles Ewart of the 2nd RNBD captured an Eagle in the action, but the whole of the British heavy cavalry were not kept in-hand, and were “blown” for the rest of the battle. Lady Elizabeth Butler’s painting “Scotland Forever” depicts their charge in all its glory, and remains one of the finest examples of patriotic art ever created.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\n Carabiniers are a brute force unit, used to deal the final blow that drives an enemy from the field of battle. They are excellent close combat troops. Their only weakness is against well-disciplined elite infantry who are capable of forming a square: this combination can prove deadly to this slow-moving unit. As heavy cavalry they are not expected to chase down an enemy, as this is a job better saved for light cavalry forces.\n\nFollowing the French Revolution, many of the royal corps in the French army were abolished and French carabiniers had every reason to expect that the same fate awaited them. In an attempt to preserve the traditions and privileges of their corps they sent Colonel Comte de Pradel to appeal to the Legislative Assembly. After a vote the new organisation of the French cavalry was decided. The carabiniers remained in service but became known as the ‘Grenadiers des troupes a cheval’ and their gold-trimmed hat was replaced with a peaked bearskin cap.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Cuirassiers are intended to charge and break enemy units in vicious melee combat.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEquipped with heavy, straight swords and wearing armour, cuirassiers are melee cavalry. If the cuirassiers can get in among their foes, then they can do bloody work and have some protection in the fight granted by their cuirasses and heavy helmets. They are rightly feared by enemy infantry, and other cavalry forces are foolish not to treat them with a degree of respect. The price paid for this imposing strength is in speed: cuirassiers are far from swift, dashing cavalrymen. They are heavyweights, and killers.\n\nIn many ways, Cuirassiers hark back to an older style of warfare: cavalrymen had always been armoured, until the widespread use of firearms meant that armour was more trouble than it was worth. The magnificence of their appearance, however, added to their worth on the battlefield. Their “Minerva” style helmets merely added to the impression that here was a unit of giants. The effect was intended to be quite intimidating, and it worked: cuirassiers were always big men on big horses, heavily armoured and well trained to use shock against any weak enemy. The French army eventually abandoned the cuirass as an item of field equipment in 1915.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Dragoons are heavy cavalry, trained to fight on foot and horseback.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Dragoons’ strength lies in their versatility: on horseback they can produce an impressive charge or they can ride to critical spots on a battlefield where firepower is needed. Once dismounted, they can engage in melee or use their muzzle-loading muskets to fire upon the enemy. This flexibility is also their greatest weakness: they are the slowest of all cavalry units and may have difficulty when facing heavier cavalry and elite infantry.\n\nHistorically, the first dragoons were infantrymen, trained to ride into battle but fight on foot. Equipping cavalry units with horses was an expensive business, and so the best were always kept for the ‘real’ cavalry, leaving the dragoons to make do with cheaper, slower steeds. Dragoons slowly changed into cavalry soldiers like any other, and stopped fighting as mounted infantry, although regiments did retain the dragoon title. The “old” cavalry had always regarded them as social inferiors, and the infantry had resented them for not being proper soldiers, so the dragoons welcomed their new acceptability as full-blown cavalry.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite heavy cavalry are renowned for their swordsmanship and fearsome charge rather than speed.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThough no longer necessarily equipped with carbines, the origin of their name, carabiniers still command respect and fear in equal measure from enemies. Rather than firepower, they have a powerful charge they use to plough through enemies, breaking and scattering men with their straight heavy swords. Their mounts are among the slowest horses used by cavalry, and are best employed in planned attacks rather than the role of reserve cavalry.\n\nHistorically, French Carabiniers had royalist roots but, unlike the other royal units, managed to escape abolition during the French Revolution, and instead found a place in France’s newly reorganised cavalry. Despite this, the carabiniers still had some royalist sympathies and frequently clashed with the Revolutionary authorities. When Napoleon came into power he showered them with “armes d’honneur” in order to gain their loyalty. It worked. After the carabiniers sustained casualties in 1809 against the Austrians, Napoleon revised their uniforms, giving them cuirasses and helmets.</long_description_text>

He met death with the same courage he always showed in battle, rejecting the offered blindfold. Early in his career he impressed Napoleon by securing the artillery that repulsed the Royalists during the 13 Vendémiaire fighting. He was repaid by being named King of Naples and Sicily. Although brave in battle, Napoleon feared that Murat had no moral courage and little intelligence. This was the case, as he turned against his former master and, when that didn’t work, tried to ingratiate himself again.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Cuirassiers are heavy cavalry who still wear armour, who rely on the shock of impact to defeat enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese big men mounted on big horses are led by General Michel Ney, and their primary task is to crash into enemy forces and engage in hand-to-hand combat. To this end, they wear “cuirass”; back and breast armoured plates over leather padding, along with reinforced metal helmets. They carry heavy straight swords. A wise commander with a cuirassier force uses it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at a critical point.\n\nIn 1799, ex-civil servant Michel Ney began his career as a hussar and by 1799 his talents had already made him a general de division. He was soon taken under Napoleon’s wing and given control of the VI Corps of the Grande Armée. He continued to serve with distinction, finally earning recognition for his bravery during Napoleon’s campaign against Russia. Whilst leading the III Corps, he and his troops were overcome by the enemy and deemed lost, but Ney managed to cut his way through the Russian lines and returned to Napoleon, who dubbed him “the bravest of the brave”. His foolish charge at Waterloo in 1815, however brave, ruined the French cavalry for the remainder of the battle.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite heavy cavalrymen are exceptional in close combat. Their straight heavy swords make short work of enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGrenadiers à Cheval ride the largest and strongest steeds. Although relatively slow, their charge into an enemy is almost certain to do terrible damage. Once in close combat, the grenadiers are strong enough to continue the slaughter. They may meet their match charging against infantry in square, or in a fight with well-disciplined elite infantry but, even then, they embrace death with the same resolve they display in attack.\n\nTo modern eyes, the concept of a mounted grenadier looks more than a little odd: surely the horses would panic at the first grenade explosion? Like all other grenadiers, the Grenadiers à Cheval were large men, chosen for their physical qualities. To be admitted to the grenadiers, a man had to been cited for bravery, have several campaigns under his belt, and be a strapping fellow. Mounted on large black horses, and resplendent in their bearskins, they made for an intimidating presence and were nicknamed ‘The Giants’ or ‘The Gods’ by their fellow Frenchmen.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These royal guard cavalrymen are gentlemen, hand picked to protect the person of the sovereign.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Garde du Corp are elite cavalry, but they are also a court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. As gentlemen they are hardly expected to associate with the common sort of soldier, and this attitude makes them unpopular with the rest of the army. However, regardless of the way they are perceived, only the best and toughest can enter the Corp, and many an enemy has met their maker at the end of their heavy swords or beneath the hooves of their thunderous charging steeds.\n\nHistorically, the Garde du Corp was the royal household cavalry, charged with the protection of the king and his household. During Napoleon’s reign as Emperor they were disbanded, although Napoleon did have an equivalent unit within his Imperial Guard. As with the Household Cavalry in Britain, household guard regiments did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have a “corporal of horse” or the equivalent. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, no matter what his rank, is ever a servant.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Fiercely proud, these elite horsemen are raised from the sons of the upper classes and have a fearsome charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men make excellent melee troops, riding hard into battle with their sabres drawn. Their only weakness is when facing well-disciplined elite infantry in square formation; this combination is one that proves deadly to slow heavy cavalry. Guards of Honour sacrifice speed for power, and are not expected to chase down an enemy. They are a brute force, a fist to smash against an enemy line, used to deal the blow that drives an enemy from the battlefield.\n\nFollowing his disastrous campaign in Russia, Napoleon returned home and set about rebuilding his Grande Armée. Cavalry units were incredibly expensive to recruit, yet Napoleon managed to recruit 10,000 elite horsemen at no expense to France’s budget. He recruited new cavalry units from the nobles and bourgeois, who were expected to provide their own horses, equipment and uniform. In return they would be assured the rank of sous-lieutenant, providing they completed 12 months service. This qualifier was to prove extremely important, as desertion was rife amongst these pampered children of the upper classes.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite heavy cavalry troops may be slow, but they make up for it by delivering a devastating charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe impact of their charge on an unprotected infantry unit is a heartening sight for nearby comrades, and a terrible one for enemy units. Once their initial charge has shaken the enemy, this unit can then engage in close combat, hacking with their straight heavy swords at anyone unfortunate to still be alive. Though powerful, they are still at a disadvantage against elite infantry and almost any infantry properly formed up in a square.\n\nHistorically, French cavalry were considered among the best during the Napoleonic Wars, despite the French not necessarily having the best individual horsemen. Instead, French cavalry strength lay in the organisation and strict discipline of the regiments. On the battlefield, the French often had remounts ready to take the place of fallen horses. Regiments were trained well enough, and expected, to change formations and strategic positions on the battlefield as and when required.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite cavalry are the Sultan’s personal guard: all men of exceptional courage and morale.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFor the Ottomans, military service is not a burden, but an honour and one that men should readily embrace. The greatest honour is reserved for the Silahtar Guard, who are charged with protecting the sultan himself. If needed these troops will lay down their lives for him; such sacrifice demands an iron resolve, and the Silahtar are not easily shaken in battle. They are armed with lances, excellent for breaking through enemy lines with a devastating charge.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the Ottoman Empire, despite still having an effective military, was not the power it had been. The Ottoman army was under-funded, and many men left the military to find other work. This was especially true of the cavalry. Many of the old feudal Sipahis had disappeared, and even the Silahtar Guard was largely diminished. Recognising the need for modernisation, Sultan Selim III (1789-1807) attempted to reform the Ottoman military along European lines. Unfortunately, the janissaries violently resisted his reforms, resulting in Selim’s murder.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These superb horsemen have an excellent charge attack and their exceptional morale makes them reliable and brave.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Siphai are unswervingly faithful and deserving of their elite status. Mounted on the finest horses, they carry ornate lances that are deadly when used at the charge. When delivered to the flanks or rear of an enemy, such a charge often proves decisive in a fight. Their heavy lances mean the Siphai are vulnerable during prolonged melee and against well-trained line infantry.\n\nAs almost feudal fief-holders, Siphai were granted the income from a parcel of land in exchange for their military service, and were expected to supply a number of armed men. They enjoyed the high status common to many cavalry corps, and the disciplined Siphai saw themselves as superior to the oft-unruly janissaries. Rivalry between the two corps was a barely concealed simmering hatred at times. A contributing factor was that Siphai were all ethnic Turks, whereas the janissaries recruited as children from provincial Christian families and converted to the Islamic faith. Despite these petty matters, Siphai represented the best horsemen available to the Sublime Porte.</long_description_text>

<key>Cav_Heavy_Prussian_Cuirassiers</key>
<description_text>Cuirassiers are heavy cavalry who rely on the shock of impact to defeat enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe primary task of cuirassiers is to crash into enemy forces and engage in close-combat. Unlike the cuirassiers of other nations, Prussians disdain the heavy cuirasses worn as protection, relying instead on cold hard steel of their heavy straight swords to win the argument. They nonetheless keep the name. A wise commander with a cuirassier force under his command uses it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at the critical point and is careful not to unleash them too soon or against unshaken, superior troops.\n\nHistorically, Frederick William II issued the order that forbade cuirassiers from wearing the cuirass in 1790. A couple of regiments had already forsaken their heavy armour three years earlier but this order specifically forbade all regiments from wearing the cuirass. The ban remained in place until 1814-1815 when cuirassiers were once again allowed to wear armour, predominantly pieces captured from French troops.\n\nCuirassiers still exist in modern armies, although their armour is now purely ceremonial. The French army still has two regiments of cuirassiers, the Italians have a Presidential Honour Guard and, technically, the Household Cavalry in the British army are also cuirassiers.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Horse Guards are an elite heavy cavalry unit, armed with deadly sabres and a devastating charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\n Heavy cavalry’s purpose is to break the enemy by shock. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks by weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: this is the work of faster, lighter cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and further confusion. However, when confronted by elite infantry in a square formation, these horsemen meet their match and charging blindly in could lead to heavy losses.\n\nHistorically, the Horse Guards Parade buildings in London were designed by William Kent, completed in 1755 and used for the “Trooping of the Colour”, a tradition that continues to this day. Indeed, the Horse Guards, as part of the Blues and Royals, themselves remain a feature of the modern British Army, although they now use tanks rather than horses.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The most prestigious unit in the Russian Imperial Guard, these cavalrymen can be used to batter an enemy with a destructive charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Chevaliers Gardé is the senior unit of the Russian Imperial Guard cavalry, charged with the personal protection of the Tsar. Only the most experienced troops gain entry into this esteemed unit, and they are as expert in close combat and horsemanship. Armed with straight, heavy cavalry swords and protected by cuirasses, they are a force to be respected. As heavy cavalry, however, they can rarely keep pace with the light cavalry.\n\nIn 1800, the Russian Chevaliers Gardé regiment was formed by Tsar Paul, a reorganisation of the existing Chevalier Guard corps. It had been a ceremonial regiment, but after 1800 the Gardé were an active field force as well. This apparently egalitarian fairness in expecting his bodyguards to actually do some fighting was about as far as Paul’s levelling instinct went. Other reforms he carried out included shutting down all private printing presses in Russia and the banning of the words “society”, “revolution” and “citizen”. If you can’t write or talk about ideas, perhaps the ideas will die…</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite heavy cavalry may be slow, but they more than make up for it with a devastating charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Lifeguard Horse troops are members of Russia’s Imperial Guard. They are a terrifying sight to behold on the battlefield. In close combat, they wield straight heavy cavalry swords and the armour they wear provides them with protection against enemy blows. Their horses are slow, but very strong, and they use them to batter and intimidate enemy infantry with powerful cavalry charges.\n\nIn 1800, army reforms split the Tsar’s Lifeguard cavalry into several different regiments: the Horse Guards, Lifeguard Hussars, Lifeguard Cossacks and, most senior of all, the Chevalier-Garde. The Lifeguard first saw action against Napoleon in the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, but were driven back by cavalry of Napoleon’s own Imperial Guard. It was Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz that effectively destroyed the Third Coalition against France and thereby altered European politics.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThese cavalrymen are expected to protect the king and his household, but they are not just a court regiment for show. With a powerful charge, they can deal a devastating blow to an enemy line. However, their horses are slow moving and, like all cavalry, vulnerable to infantry in square. As heavy cavalry they are little use chasing down enemies; they are at their best when used to deal a crushing blow to an enemy.\n\nHistorically, Spain’s reputation as a European power had suffered greatly under the rule of the Hapsburg family and Charles II. However, King Carlos III instigated a cultural revival, and his reign quickly became known as the “Ilustracion”. The arts, sciences and economy flourished as intellectuals embraced new ideas from all over the globe and travelled Europe to broaden their understanding. The army also saw a marked improvement, thanks to forward-thinking generals, who attempted to emulate the French army, correctly regarded as the best in western Europe.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Ulans are fast-moving lancers, and terrific shock cavalry who can batter an enemy into flight.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike all lancers, it is their weapons that give them a distinct advantage in the first seconds of contact. A unit of lancers, charging into the attack, is frightening indeed to the targets of their ire. However, a lance is not the handiest of weapons in a melee, so the ulans should break off, reform and charge anew rather than stay in hand-to-hand combat. Like all shock cavalry, they should not be thrown into ill-considered attacks against prepared or elite infantry in square formations.\n\nThe Austrian decision to raise lancer regiments was a consequence of conquering former Polish provinces: Polish manpower was there to be exploited, and Poles were regarded as expert lancers. The first units were raised by the order of Emperor Joseph II (1741-90), but it was under his successor, Leopold, that the first proper regiments were created. The Poles had a long tradition of fielding lancer regiments, and the Austrians made full use of this experience. Ulans were armed, dressed, and trained in a distinctly Polish style: the rank and file were also mostly Polish speakers.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These cavalrymen are armed with lances that make them particularly deadly when charging.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe lance is probably the oldest cavalry weapon. It allows the user to put all his weight, and that of his charging horse, behind one very sharp point. In the hands of a skilled man that point can be driven right through a man. This makes lances intimidating to face but, if a lancer does not kill his target, he is vulnerable: a lance is less use than a sword in a melee, so the lancer is at a disadvantage. This is also true against well-trained infantry capable of forming square.\n\nHistorically, many nations used lancers. Napoleon even recruited Polish lancers to be part of his Imperial Guard. Surprisingly, each type of cavalry regiment required its own set of horse furniture, especially designed for the tactics that would be used. Lancer saddles tended to be made of beech wood, covered in black leather and reinforced with metal bands. They differed from the more elaborate dragoon saddle that required holsters for pistols, and a heavy sheepskin to protect the weapons and the lower body of the rider.</long_description_text>

A lance that can, in skilled hands, be driven right through any enemy. When coupled with the fast pace of their horses, a lancer’s charge is very intimidating. However, if the lancer does not kill his target, he leaves himself vulnerable. A long lance is less use in a melee than a sword, and a lancer is at a disadvantage once the close fighting starts, especially against well-trained infantry capable of forming square.\n\nHistorically, many nations used lancers. The French army adopted lancers with some enthusiasm, and Napoleon even included Polish lancers in his Imperial Guard. In India the lance had long been used as a weapon: lancer skills were often practiced by “pegging”, picking tent pegs out of the ground with the lance tip, or “pig-sticking”, the hunting of wild pigs or even wild dogs with the lance.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThe Brandenburg Uhlans are lucky enough to count some of the most experienced cavalrymen in Europe among their number. These men are excellent riders and can persuade their steeds into breathtaking acts of speed, be it to reach a surrounded friendly unit or to charge down a routing enemy unit. However, should these men find themselves in prolonged close combat they will quickly suffer heavy losses. They are best employed in short, sharp attacks that give them room to manoeuvre.\n\nHistorically, Major Fredirick von Schill of the Prussian army was the original commander of what would later become the Brandenburg Uhlans. It was his actions that would lead Fredrick II to rename the regiment. Schill decided that the newly-created state of Westphalia was ripe for rebellion and made the ill-advised decision to rise against Napoleon. This revolt was quickly crushed, and Schill paid a terrible price for his folly. He was decapitated, his body was dumped in an unmarked grave, and his head was sent to Jerome Bonaparte, the ruler of Westphalia, as a trophy.</long_description_text>

<description_text>This unit of lancers are a powerful force of shock cavalry, able to break through units with a charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Towarczys lancers are a unique force in Prussian service: fast moving, and with high morale thanks to their self-belief. Trained to attack at the full gallop, their lances give them an advantage in the first few moments of hand-to-hand combat. This is often enough to break unprepared or disorganised enemies. Like all lancers, however, they are not good in a prolonged fight, and should withdraw and regroup rather than stay in a melee. Only a foolish commander would order them to attack prepared infantry in a square.\n\nOriginally, these troops had been the Bosniaks in Prussian service but, after 1800 they were recruited from Polish territory that had been recently conquered by Prussia. Despite the changes, they remained light lancers, indeed the only lancers in the Prussian army until the Uhlans were raised in 1808. The regiment adapted a traditional Polish idea of the nobility serving as cavalry officers called “towarzysz”, or companions. Originally, these men had joined the army with their followers, and their pay and privileges were entirely dependent on the size of their personal retinue. The Corps Towarczys was present at the Battle of Eylau in 1807, as part of the 3rd Division of the Prussian Corps; this small force was pretty much all that was left of the Prussian military after their crushing defeat at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Cossacks are a free warrior people, fine horsemen and terrible foes.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCossacks are cavalrymen without peer, as might be expected of steppe folk. There are few soldiers that can withstand their terrifying charge, making them excellent shock troops. As is often the case, their courage and eagerness to enter battle betrays a certain wildness; their undisciplined nature can find them plunging blindly into trouble, making them particularly vulnerable in melee.\n\nHistorically, Russians and other Eastern Europeans had an ambiguous relationship with the Cossacks. There was admiration for their warrior culture and freewheeling ways, yet a certain wariness of their wild nature. They lacked the discipline of other troops and had a certain fondness for drink, but it was their constant harassment that helped destroy Napoleon’s Grand Armée. Their reputation inspired fear in their enemies and won many a fight even before the Cossacks voiced their deafening war cries.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are an elite light cavalry force, excellent against skirmishers and artillery. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards their enemies. The 1st Hussars are, without exception, superb horsemen, and all have a certain independence of spirit that makes them ideal for chasing down widely scattered men. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is a powerful attack, they are weak when pitted against infantry in square and against heavy cavalry units.\n\nAustria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” in the mid-15th Century, and they had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, Duke of Austria and the King of Hungary and Croatia, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon added hussars to their own armies and enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash”, and an elitist attitude towards enemies. Hungarian hussars are, without exception, superb equestrians, as might be expected for a Magyar force. Their organisational origin as irregular forces, reputedly recruited from brigands and bandits, gives them a certain independence of spirit and makes them ideal for chasing down skirmishers and dealing with artillery units. They carry a curved sabre and, even though their charge is effective, they are still weak against infantry formed in square.\n\nHistorically, Austria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” as far back as the mid-15th Century. They had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary and Croatia and Duke of Austria, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon copied the ideas and hussars to their own armies. Many enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen. In some armies, hussar uniforms grew ever more gaudy, exaggerated, and rather lewdly suggestive in the cut of their very tight breeches!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Mounted on camels, these warriors are particularly effective in melee and terrifying when on the charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLiving in a desert makes a man tough and ruthless, or dead. The weak do not survive, and this fierce life produces proud and dangerous warriors. Their battle skills have been honed by years of raiding, goat thievery and fighting against the more settled people of oasis villages. The smell of camels riding into battle terrifies horses, giving these Bedouin warriors the edge over European cavalry. However, should they meet European elite infantry their weakness becomes apparent as their cumbersome steeds make excellent targets.\n\nTraditionally, the name Bedouin is derived from the Arabic word ‘Bedu’ meaning ‘inhabitant of the desert.’ The Bedouin were among the most dangerous of desert tribes, fighting among themselves when outsiders weren’t available. Constantly on the move to find new pastures for their livestock, the Bedouin learned to live with the minimum of possessions and external support in the harshest of conditions. Loyalty to tribe and family was all that helped a man survive.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are an elite light cavalry force, and effective when used against skirmishers and artillery.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards enemies. The 15th Hussars are made up of veteran cavalrymen, deadly in close combat and at the charge. Their speed makes them ideal for chasing down skirmishers and for dealing with artillery units. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is powerful, they are still at a disadvantage against infantry in square and heavy cavalry units.\n\nThe 15th Hussars were changed from light dragoon regiments as hussar regiments became fashionable across Europe. Colonel George Augustus Elliot raised “Elliot’s Light Horse”, a regiment of light dragoons. Less than a year after being raised the regiment was already 684 men strong and was marked out for overseas service. They took part in the Battle of Emsdorf, where they earned the very first named Battle Honour ever given to a British regiment. Eventually, the regiment became the 15th Hussars.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Speed and agility, coupled with the ability to fight both mounted and on foot makes these men indispensable.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFast moving and highly skilled, these light dragoons are a useful and versatile unit. Their true skill lies in horsemanship, although they need to dismount to use their carbines. Their flexibility in battle makes them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers. However, should they find themselves facing well-disciplined line infantry in square their weaknesses will swiftly become apparent.\n\nHistorically, the dragoons and the light dragoons of the Kings German Legion were quartered in Weymouth, on south coast of England, along with two horse artillery batteries. The barracks were often visited by King George III and the men were his particular favourites. He would walk among the men as he oversaw drill, discussing news of home in Germany and joking with them. He even took to wearing the uniform of the dragoons during his visits. The practice of visiting the men of the Kings German Legion didn’t die with George III; the then-Prince of Wales and other members of the Royal family continued this tradition for years to come.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussards are a light cavalry force, and very effective when sent against skirmishers and artillery. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese veterans of the American War of Independence possess hard-earned battle experience. Light and fast, they can quickly reach areas of the battlefield where they are most needed, cutting down the enemy with their curved sabres. Their speed makes them especially effective against units such as artillery and skirmishers, as they can close before taking too much fire. Heavier cavalry units or line infantry in square will overmatch the Hussards, as their mounts are chosen for speed, not strength.\n\nThe 5e Regiment de Hussards has its roots in the Légion de Lauzun, which was formed in 1778 and saw action during the American War of Independence. The regiment earned itself a reputation for bravery and stoic resolve at the Battle of Yorktown where it chased down a unit of light horse commanded by the famous British commander Banastre Tarleton. The Légion de Lauzun was renamed in 1793 and became the 5e Regiment de Hussards, seeing service in several key battles of the Napoleonic Wars before eventually being disbanded in November 1815.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Fast moving and good in melee, these light cavalrymen can pursue fleeing enemies and keep them from regrouping.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light cavalrymen do not hold with armour, even the sensible steel skull caps many other units favour beneath their officially-sanctioned hats and caps. Chasseurs à Cheval carry swords, carbines and pistols, but they are not expected to charge home, merely harass and pursue enemies. This makes them effective against skirmishers and artillery. Their horses have good endurance, are fast and properly looked after: a cavalryman without his horse is useless. They are vulnerable when matched against heavier cavalry and well-trained infantry in square.\n\nHistorically, the Chasseurs à Cheval were given the impressive nickname of ‘Invincibles’ by Napoleon. The men of this regiment were veterans from the Guides à Cheval, a regiment created to guard Napoleon’s headquarters when he was on campaign in Italy. The Chasseurs went on to act as a personal escort to Napoleon, following him everywhere. So deep was Napoleon’s respect for this unit and its men that he regularly chose to appear in public sporting their green undress uniform. This affectation also suited his sense of theatre and emphasised his common touch with the ordinary soldiers.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are light cavalry, fast moving and useful for scouting ahead of an army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese superb horsemen can be used as a screen for the main army, or for strategic scouting to locate the enemy. Hussar speed makes them ideal for targeting skirmishers and artillery: enemies have little chance to escape if hussars are sent against them. Hussars are armed with curved sabres, and can acquit themselves well in melee or during a charge, although they do not fare well against disciplined infantry or heavy cavalry.\n\nHistorically, hussars of all nations enjoyed the freebooting attitude of the Hungarian originals, and acted independently of the main army as much as they could. This was useful, because they could be sent out to do long patrols or reconnaissance, and possibly a little plundering. Their high-spirited approach to war was matched by their popinjay uniforms, some of the gaudiest ever to have been worn into battle. Hussar arrogance, however, was well deserved: in 1806 some 500 French hussars bluffed a 6,000-strong Prussian garrison at Stettin into surrendering the fortress there.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Light dragoons are mounted skirmishers, riding to a fight then engaging the enemy on foot.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDragoon’s horses are primarily for mobility, but they are also fast and can deliver a reasonably effective charge. These characteristics make light dragoons effective against skirmishers and artillery: they can close quickly enough to not suffer too many casualties. When mounted, they are effective with their curved sabres, but to use their carbines they must dismount first. On foot, they are vulnerable to enemies in melee.\n\nHistorically, light dragoons often performed as a kind of police force, and were useful in suppressing riotous and rebellious civilians. Their horses give them strategic mobility, allowing them to control large areas and quickly come to the aid of the local, civil authorities. As the 18th Century drew to a close, they had lost their role as mounted infantry and most became another kind of light cavalry, although they retained the dragoon name. The officers and men welcomed the change, as “proper” cavalrymen had glamour for the ladies, a higher social status, and better pay rates!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Mamelukes are fearless light horsemen, deadly when deployed against a broken or unsupported enemy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMounted on seemingly tireless light horses and armed with scimitars, they are commonly employed to harass an enemy force, restricting its space to manoeuvre easily. Once battle is fully joined, they will often time their charges to coincide with those of a supporting infantry unit, seeking to break the enemy quickly then wreak havoc amongst them as they flee. Their only real weakness is when facing well-trained European infantry capable of forming square.\n\nMamelukes were traditionally slave-soldiers of the various caliphs and sultans of the Middle Ages, captured as children and raised in the Islamic faith to provide their master with a force of men unconnected to any part of the social hierarchy. Over time, the Mamelukes accrued power of their own and even went as far as seizing control of Egypt, founding a Mameluke Sultanate in 1250. Though the Mamelukes’ strength enabled the Sultanate to repel several invasions by Christian crusaders and Mongols, they were eventually overpowered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517 and entered into the service of the Sublime Porte.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These extravagantly dressed light cavalry are an extremely useful force for any Ottoman general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese troops are recruited from many peoples, and have an ethos of personal, rather than collective, bravery. They are armed with curved sabres and these can cause terrible wounds in hand-to-hand combat. Although they are skilled in close combat and cavalry charges, Deli Horsemen are primarily favoured for their speed across ground. This makes them an obvious choice to destroy vulnerable skirmishers and artillery.\n\nHistorically, Deli infantrymen and cavalry were irregular troops, and horsemen would often find employment guarding caravans and important dignitaries. By the late 18th century, the elite horsemen of the feudal Sipahis had largely disappeared, and most of the Ottoman cavalry force was made up of the irregular Deli horse. They had no uniforms to speak of, but could be recognised by their black felt hats. The other point of recognition, for as long as an enemy lived, was their spectacular mixture of whatever weaponry they could find or steal!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are an elite light cavalry force, armed with curved sabres and excellent against skirmish troops and artillery.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAll hussars have “dash” and a touch of derring-do in their collective attitude towards war. Pavlograd hussars are, without exception, excellent horsemen, ideal for chasing down skirmishers and overrunning artillery units. Though their charge is powerful, they are still weak against infantry in square and will suffer losses in prolonged close combat. Instead, they are better used to quickly attack, then break away and attack again.\n\nThe Pavlograd Hussars were immortalised in Tolstoy’s epic novel “War and Peace”, but their fame was well established before Tolstoy penned his masterpiece. In 1797, a young Georgian officer, Spiridon Zhevahov, took command of the Pavlograd Hussars and led them to impressive triumphs against Napoleon’s forces. The Hussars shocked the French by crushing the 3rd Lancers of the Young Guard, part of Napoleon’s personal guard. To add insult to injury, they also managed to capture the 3rd Lancers’ standard, a major blow to French prestige.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These camel-mounted irregulars are armed with carbines and are born skirmishers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHorses cannot stand the smell of camels, and this gives all camel riders the advantage in melee. However, these soldiers are most effective when using their firepower to harass enemies, whittling down their numbers to the point where a charge will break them. They are also swift and very manoeuvrable, and this can be used to keep them out of trouble as well as send them to a critical point in battle. They will not, however, survive for long if they are sent against a disciplined and well-handled line infantry unit.\n\nHistorically, the Bedouin people talked before resorting to the feud, although they were very adept at defending themselves when needed. Life in the desert was harsh and unforgiving, and unnecessary squabbles or attempts to save face through violence did nothing for a man’s survival. The Bedouin were raiders on other folk but that was a matter of survival, and directed, as often as not, against outsiders.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Astride fast moving and manoeuvrable steeds, these carbine and sabre armed men are excellent skirmish troops.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFearsome and powerful beasts, these camels terrify regular cavalry horses with their distinctive reek. Their long limbs and striding gait make them incredibly manoeuvrable; their riders are armed with sabres and carbines, and excel in skirmish warfare. Able to effectively avoid trouble, their only major tactical weakness is when engaged in prolonged attacks against well-trained infantry or in melee against a superior cavalry unit.\n\nHistorically, camel cavalry were often used to panic enemy horses. All horses, unless accustomed to camels, hate their smell and became uncontrollable when near them. Camels have proven to be extremely useful beasts throughout the world: the one-humped dromedaries are now largely domesticated, with only a few living wild in their original homelands. There are, however, estimated to be 300,000 wild camels in Australia, escapees from the herd brought in to act as transport in the desert interior. At the time of writing, the Australian authorities are considering a cull, as the camel has no natural predators in the outback.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThese men have been hardened for battle by the merciless nature of the desert, a place that is utterly unforgiving to the weak. A man who cannot fight is unlikely to survive the life of feuding and banditry that is his lot. Unlike many of their enemies, the shaturnal camel gunners are extremely swift and manoeuvrable force, and have perfected their skirmish tactics. An extra edge in combat is gained from their camels: enemy horses are easily scared by these gurning, spitting creatures!\n\nHistorically, a shaturnal was a kind of swivel gun mounted on the back of a camel or an elephant. Rather than using the camel to simply transport the gun, the weapon was actually fired with the gun still attached to the animal. Because there was no need to dismount to use the weapon, it could be brought into action very quickly.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Good all-round cavalry, Chevauxlégers are trained in heavy and light cavalry tactics.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Chevauxléger regiments may not be the strongest or fastest cavalry, but their courage cannot be faulted. What they lack in specialisation they compensate for by versatility: they can be set almost any cavalry task to do. A wise commander needs to bear in mind that they should not be pitted against heavier, more professional cavalry. Instead, they can be used to attack light infantry or as relief for beleaguered comrades.\n\nThe Austrian cavalry of the Napoleonic Wars were one of the most powerful forces of the period, but they were often hampered by the poor quality of regimental officers. Officially, good officers were recognised as vital to success, even more so than having good men in the rank and file. Yet favouritism, patronage and personal politics meant that command positions were often given to men with the right connections. Idiots, reckless fools and cowards could be, and were, appointed to command. If they were lucky, the men of their regiments were good enough to save them and their reputations.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Armed with straight swords, these cavalry are competent troops.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nPortuguese horses, although hardy and reliable, are neither large nor fast enough to be used for heavy or light cavalry. For this reason, they are used as mounts in a kind of all-purpose cavalry, slower than light cavalry and weaker than most heavy cavalry units. Despite this lack of specialisation, they are still useful on the battlefield and fight courageously. They must be deployed with a little care, as charging them into well-trained line infantry squares will only lead to heavy losses.\n\nHistorically, cavalry regiments were the weakest arm of the Portuguese forces. They had difficulty raising effective cavalry due to Portugal’s lack of natural resources required to produce remounts. It was hard to find enough forage to sustain the horses, and the native animals were not large, or swift. As a result, Portuguese cavalry was never organised as specialised regiments and failed to fulfil the needed tactical roles. To be fair, Portugal simply did not have the spare land required for large herds of horses.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nArmed with a traditional straight sword, as opposed to the ever-popular sabre, these cavalrymen are a multipurpose unit. They are light enough to chase down a routing enemy, but heavy enough to charge effectively into enemy lines. However, their versatility comes at the cost of specialisation: should they be pitted against the likes of horse guards, their lack of specialist training will become apparent. \n\nSpain and the Peninsular War proved to be a major part in the downfall of Napoleon and this was thanks, in part, to his older brother Joseph. Joseph helped his brother to take control of France during the revolution and was rewarded with the throne of Naples in 1806. His time as king was brief, and he was soon sent elsewhere when Spain fell under Napoleon’s control. Napoleon needed someone he could trust on the Spanish throne and Joseph was the obvious choice. However, French occupation of Spain was unpopular to say the least and Joseph never really managed to gain a steady grip on the country. French control was eventually broken at the Battle of Vitoria and Joseph abdicated, fleeing back to France.</long_description_text>

<key>Frigate_24</key>
<description_text>A frigate is a fast and manoeuvrable single-deck vessel, used for reconnaissance and missions in distant waters.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis 24-gun ship is not a ship-of-the-line, and would not last long in combat against such an opponent. Rather than heavy firepower, it is built for speed and easy handling; the guns on board are much lighter than those used by even the smallest battle ship. A frigate is not suited to close combat, its hull and masts would not survive a heavy enemy broadside. Instead, their advantage lies in the long range qualities of their relatively accurate 9-pounder guns, and their manoeuvrability against lumbering ships. They can, quite simply, outmanoeuvre larger opponents, and choose to run if the odds are against them.\n\nHistorically, a frigate’s guns were all mounted together on a single deck well above the waterline. Warships often had their guns split between the upper and lower decks, and during rough weather would have to close the lower gun ports to prevent swamping. A frigate had no guns close to the waterline, so was not handicapped by this problem and could deploy all its guns all the time. A frigate was seen as a desirable posting for a young officer, as it offered the chance of prize money and the chance to be noticed as a dashing and brave commander.</long_description_text>

<key>Frigate_32</key>
<description_text>A 32-gun frigate is a single deck warship, mostly used for convoy raiding and protection.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis square-rigged ship is armed with 12-pounders on the only gun deck. The cannons it carries do not have the same punch as the guns found on larger ships, but they are more than capable of damaging smaller ships. The speed and handling characteristics of a 32-gun frigate allow it to choose when and where to engage a slower enemy. Whereas most ships must blast away at close range, this frigate can pepper an enemy at a distance.\n\nThe first 32-gun frigates were introduced in 1756 and classed as “fifth rates” by the Royal Navy. The Southampton-class of frigates were British built and had more headroom on the lower deck than the French frigate models. British frigates had been derived from the French designs: the British were impressed with the French design, and copied captured examples for their own fleet. Although not usually commanded by a full captain, a frigate was a desirable ship for an ambitious officer as it gave him a taste of independent command.</long_description_text>

<key>Frigate_38</key>
<description_text>This single-deck vessel carries 18-pounder cannons, giving it a substantial broadside for such a manoeuvrable ship.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis frigate is the largest design of the type, and the relatively heavy 18-pounders it carries balance both firepower and reasonable accuracy. Against another frigate, the 38 is a dangerous opponent, but in close combat against a ship-of-the-line it is outmatched: like all frigates, it has been built for speed, not hull strength. In battle against a powerful enemy the best strategy is to keep out of range, and choose when and where to engage, taking advantage of the fact that the crew can reload the 18-pounders relatively quickly.\n\nHistorically, frigates were usually involved in single-ship actions, against other frigates rather than set-piece fleet battles involving ships-of-the-line. In fact, it was seen as ungentlemanly for a ship-of-the-line to fire upon a frigate, unless the frigate fired first. In such a case, the frigate captain had shown that he was ready for a fight that he was unlikely to win. This was not the only quirky rule of naval combat in the period. It was common to “clear for action” and put the captain’s furniture in a ship’s boat that was towed during any fight. It was considered very unsporting for an enemy to shoot at a captain’s private property!</long_description_text>

<key>Frigate_British_Razee</key>
<description_text>A razee is a type of strongly-built frigate, created by cutting the top deck off a ship-of-the-line.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIn effect, a small ship of the line is sawn in two, horizontally, and the top deck removed completely. The resulting ship has a hull that was originally constructed to withstand the recoil of heavy guns and, as a result, it is far stronger than an ordinary, purpose-built frigate. The loss of a deck and guns improves the ship’s handling too, and a razee is manoeuvrable and speedy. The overall result is a very strong, powerful vessel that is better than its donor battleship or a frigate.\n\nHistorically, few razees were actually made, as sacrificing a ship-of-the-line to make a weaker vessel was not an action that many admiralties could get their political masters to approve. However, one of the most successful examples was HMS Indefatigable, under Edward Pellew. In the company of another frigate, Pellew took on, and defeated, the Droits de l&apos;Homme, a French 74 ship-of-the-line, in 1797. This victory was rightly considered a stunning feat of seamanship and command. During the next year or so, Pellew and the Indefatigable went on to take a further nine vessels.</long_description_text>

<key>Frigate_Carronade_Frigate</key>
<description_text>Carronade frigates are single-deck vessels, with extremely impressive short-range firepower. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nNormally frigates would be armed with long guns, probably no larger than 12-pounders. A few short-barrelled 64-pounder carronades might be aboard to give a close-in broadside more weight of shot. A carronade frigate goes one better, and carries nothing but carronades – short guns that are half the weight of the equivalent conventional cannon. While the weight of a broadside is truly awesome, the frigate has to get in close in order to blow an enemy to smithereens thanks to the carronades’ limited range. A clever enemy will stay out of range of the carronades’ horrendous power and take long range pot shots.\n\nHistorically, only the Royal Navy experimented with an all-carronade armament aboard HMS Glatton (in service from 1795). Glatton carried 28 64-pounder and 28 32-pounder carronades, giving a weight of fire that was more than 17% greater than HMS Victory could deliver at the Battle of Trafalgar! This massive firepower allowed her, on one occasion, to chase all eight vessels in a French squadron back into port. Oddly enough, the next two vessels to carry the name “Glatton” in RN service were also massively over-armed.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to throw a general and his bodyguards into combat to shore up a weak position, or break through in a critical part of the line, this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\n\nNo Ottoman commander gained his position by being overly concerned about the welfare of his men. Any who showed weakness would have been removed, if not by the sultan then by the fanatically conservative ultra-loyalists of the janissary corps. Other than protecting their own privileges and perquisites, the janissaries were also very protective of the state and its dignity. Of course, a commander who was too successful and threatened the janissaries’ hold on power by possibly taking it away would also have to be cautious of his personal safety.</long_description_text>

He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to use a general in combat this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\n\nAhmed al-Jazzar was an Ottoman pasha, or general, who was born in Bosnia, then a Turkish province. He is best known in Western histories for his successful defence of Acre when the city was besieged by Napoleon in 1799. Despite this heroic stand, the pasha was not loved by the people of Acre, or anywhere else unfortunate enough to suffer his rule. He was a cruel man, even in a time when cruelty was considered a legitimate tool of government. He was reputed to keep a mobile gallows to hand, so that those who offended could have the error of their ways swiftly corrected. He died in 1804, having rebuilt Acre to a large extent, but without being extravagantly mourned. His real achievement is in stopping Napoleon’s Syrian campaign before it could get properly started.</long_description_text>

Although Bennigsen led a distinguished career in the Russian army, rising quickly through the ranks, he was removed from military service due to his involvement in the plot to assassinate Tsar Paul I. This seemed of little consequence to the Tsar’s heir, Alexander I, who reinstated Bennigsen immediately after his father’s death and made him a general of cavalry in 1802. He was later awarded the Order of St. Andrew, the highest order bestowed by the Russian empire.</long_description_text>

A general who carries the respect of his soldiers is a valuable asset and should be treasured. It is advisable to keep him out of the thick of battle, not just for his protection but also so he can be sent to where he can inspire and rally men for maximum effect.\n\nFormer corporal of the French royalist army Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&apos;Erlon, was one of Napoleon’s ablest generals, and given command of I Corps during the 100 Days. Having risen from the ranks during the revolution, he proved to be a very able man and fought on virtually every front during the Napoleonic Wars, including in Spain. Unlike the Emperor, he therefore had direct experience of what the British could do in battle. This, however, did not help him during the attack on La Haye Sainte, one of the key moments of Waterloo.\n\nD’Erlon survived the final fall of Napoleon, and was eventually rehabilitated and employed by the Bourbon monarchy as Governor of Algeria. Recalled, he was made a Marshal of France and retired before he died, in bed.</long_description_text>

His importance to army morale cannot be underestimated, and it is foolhardy to risk him in direct combat. He should be kept well out of range of the enemy and his sword, if it is ever drawn, should only be raised with a rallying cry to bring men back to the cause.\n\nAs a young man, Arthur Wellesley (1769-1852) showed little of the promise and drive that would later earn him honours from numerous European nations and make him one of the most famous British generals of all time. During his early twenties, his mother worried about Arthur’s prospects until he left to study horsemanship in France. Upon his return, he displayed a new focus, bought a commission and took to politics. However, it wasn’t until he was denied permission to marry the woman he loved, and took himself to India, that he resolved to completely dedicate himself to a career in the military. His meteoric rise may have been helped, a little, by his brother who was the Governor General of British India at the time.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nNapoleon’s presence alone is enough to inspire battle weary troops to fight on, even in the bleakest of situations.

It is advisable to keep him away from the thick of the fighting: it is his task to have a cool head, not be pre-occupied with swinging a sword.\n\nFrom an early age Napoleon’s school masters commented on his pride and ambition, aspects of his personality that were to follow him through to adulthood. Many of his teachers took the time to nurture this talented and promising young man, but none more so than Baron du Teil, the commandant of the artillery school Napoleon attended. He helped lay the foundations for Napoleon’s skills with artillery and helped him to develop a better understanding of tactical concepts which he would later use to outstanding effect. Even as a mature commander, Napoleon never lost his grasp of the simple truth that artillery won battles for him.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These tough soldiers have only one job: keeping their general alive in the middle of a battle.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA routing unit can often cause other units to doubt themselves, and panic can easily spread through the ranks. When soldiers waver, a general’s presence can inspire courage and make men redouble their efforts. His importance also makes him a target for the enemy; a sensible general has a bodyguard of his best soldiers. These men are fiercely loyal and protective of their general, never leaving his side unless all else is lost.\n\nIn 1796, General Napoleon Bonaparte created his own bodyguard of 200 men after a too-close call with some Austrian cavalry. These men were forerunners to the Chasseurs à Cheval of the Guard. Naturally, being the first, they were favoured by Napoleon. Indeed, they were called the ‘Favoured Children’ and, like all children, were often indulged too much and undisciplined. Still, only the most talented men would be recruited to guard the Emperor and, during many of his battles, they proved their skill and bravery in defence of their Emperor.</long_description_text>

A general who carries the respect of his troops is a valuable asset and should be protected in battle.

However, a slight tendency towards excess often meant he was passed over for promotion, leading him to resign his commission in 1773. Upon receiving this resignation Fredrick the Great was reported to say “Captain Blücher can take himself to the devil.” He was blacklisted, and Blücher was unable to rejoin the army until after the death of Fredrick. Once back, he distinguished himself, going on to play one of the key roles in the Allied victory at Waterloo.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nMorale is vital in battle. If one unit routs, another may panic and follow. This can be disastrous for any army, and the presence of a commander who can steady the men should never be underrated. The man who can rally his men, give them courage in the face of overwhelming odds, and still be clear-headed enough to take decisions that may kill them, in the cause of victory, is an indispensable asset. Such generals are more important than armies.\n\nJohann Beaulieu (1725-1819) was an intelligent and knowledgeable general. In his private life he was an art lover and collector and a follower of science. His taste for finer and intellectual things in life did not adversely affect his ability on the battlefield. Working his way up the ranks from cavalry officer to full general, he was renowned for being cool-headed, brave and wise. During the Battle of Lodi in 1796, he fought and lost against Napoleon, at the time a newly appointed general, but Beaulieu would not be the last to do that.</long_description_text>

He played a key role in gathering the Tyrolean militia who resisted Napoleon during his advance across Italy in 1796. He and his new recruits were sent to relieve Mantua and break Napoleon’s siege. At first successful, Alvinczi won a victories at Caldiero and Bassano.

His importance to morale cannot be underestimated, and so placing him in harm’s way in combat would be extremely foolish.

He actually became Napoleon’s friend during negotiations over Bonaparte’s marriage to Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria. Napoleon respected him enough to give him command of the Austrian corps attached to the Grand Armée in 1812. When Austria joined the Allies in 1814, Schwarzenberg found himself fighting against his friend. He was instrumental in taking Paris and thereby forcing Napoleon into exile on Elba.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A general who has the stomach to send men to their deaths, and yet command their respect, is worth his weight in gold.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. Although it might be tempting to throw a general and his bodyguards into combat to shore up a weak position, or break through in a critical part of the line, this is a waste. A general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\n\nMichelangelo-Colli Alessandro Marchini, to use his full name, was an Austrian Feldmarschal-Leutnant in Italy, who opposed with limited success, the advance of the French army. He was rather unfortunate to be facing a military genius Napoleon Bonaparte who, in 1796, had everything to prove on his first campaign. Colli was in charge of a Sardinian army, and was neatly separated from the Austria main force under General Beaulieu. He was later appointed to command the army of the Papal States, without any great success, and then he was attached to the Neapolitan army, under another Austrian commander, Karl Mack von Leiberich. Colli ended his days in Florence, as an Austrian ambassador.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Honoured to defend Mother Russia, this general inspires nearby troops.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe men serving under General Mikhail Kutuzov respect and trust his strategies and orders. Unlike many generals who have bought commissions, he has earned his position through success, not politics. As a result, his men would follow him into the mouth of Hell. His presence alone will make it harder to rout his troops: their faith in him really is that strong. For this reason, he should be kept out of the front line. Although he is armed with a sword his strength is leadership, and his death would be a great blow to the troops.\n\nMikhail Kutziv or Kutuzov (1745-1813) was a Field Marshal famed for defeating the French Grand Armée during Napoleon’s ill-fated invasion of Russia in 1812. By this time, Kutuzov had lost an eye in service, giving him a menacing countenance, and had achieved great honour during the Russo-Turkish Wars. He was a follower of the great Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov (1729-1800), something that certainly gave him the necessary military skills.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A general who can send men to their deaths, and command respect for doing so, is worth his weight in gold.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMurad Bey can inspire his men to fight on, even when they are bone weary and ready to run. Such a man, who has the respect and adoration of his followers is a valuable asset to any state, and should be treated well. It is advisable to keep this man away from combat, for his death could prove disastrous.\n\nMurad Bey was the fierce Mameluke chieftain that faced the French at the famous Battle of the Pyramids. Even after their defeat at the hands of Napoleon and his troops, Murad regrouped his men and remained a threat to the French for some time. The Turkish word “Bey” literally means chieftain and was the original word used to describe Ottoman leaders; later it replaced sultan as a title. Bey was used to refer to military and administrative positions that were lower in status than the “Pashas”, who were governors of Ottoman provinces. As the 19th century began, Bey came to be used as an honorific equivalent to ‘mister’ in English.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A general who can lead men into the face of death, and command respect while doing so, is worth his marshal’s baton.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA general inspires his men to greater efforts by his presence, if he truly has the gift of command. He need only obey the 17th Century military dictum of “pay well, command well, hang well” to ensure that his troops know exactly what is expected of them. If he does more, then he will be a true prince of battles! Yet, a general is not a combat unit: it is his job to command, not bathe his sword in the blood of enemies.\n\nGeneral Louis Aloy Prince de Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein was a remarkable soldier. He served in the armies of the Palatinate, his father’s domain of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein, the Netherlands, Austria, and eventually France, but only after the fall of Napoleon. He commanded, with some distinction, a regiment of French princes who had been exiled after the Revolution. After what can only be described as an adventurous early career, he became an Austrian major-general, and was then promoted to Feldmarshallleutnant and governor of Galicia. Napoleon attempted to bribe him, with his father’s old lands, into service with the Confederation of the Rhine, a French puppet state, but he refused. He did, however, serve in the French army after the Bourbon restoration, and died a Marshal of France, thanks to his excellent record.</long_description_text>

<key>Gen_Tsar_Alexander</key>
<description_text>A commanding general can inspire his men to great feats of valour, and hold them with his will when all seems lost.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis man’s presence alone is enough to inspire the battle-weary rank and file great efforts, even in their bleakest moments. A general who carries the respect of his troops is a valuable asset and should be protected in battle. Apart from anything else, it is not wise to expose the Tsar to the cut and thrust of battle. He should have his mind on command, not dodging bullets.\n\nThe circumstances that surrounded Alexander I’s death were intriguing, even in comparison to his interesting life. In 1825, his wife’s doctors recommended a trip to the Russian southern city of Taganrog, as the Tsarina had been sick for some time. During their stay, Alexander developed typhus and died. The sudden and unexpected nature of his death led many to speculate that he had faked his own death and left the country to begin a new life in peace and solitude. Some even believed that he took the name Feodor Kozmich and became a hermit, although this was never proven. Regardless of rumour or truth, when Tsar Alexander’s tomb was opened by the later Soviet government it was found to be completely empty.</long_description_text>

<key>Inf_Elite_British_Black_Watch</key>
<description_text>These elite soldiers are an inspiration to others by their example, and dashed handy in a fight to boot!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEquipped like other line regiments with muskets and bayonets, the Black Watch are easily distinguished on the field by their bonnets and dark tartan kilts. This alone marks them out as something special. They are an excellent unit, with high morale and extremely good fighting characteristics. They are particularly fearsome when charging home, as Highlanders have a reputation for savagery in battle that is all their own. Like all line infantry, however, their courage counts for little if they are left exposed to artillery fire.\n\nThe 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot recruited most of its soldiers in Scotland and supposedly got its nickname from the dark green tartan sett that the regiment wore; unlike other Scottish units, it did not wear a clan tartan but a government-issue pattern.  The regiment was originally raised after the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 to police the more rampantly Tory (rebel) clans. In this, it was only partly successful. The 42nd fought under Wellington in Spain and were present at both Quatre Bras and Waterloo in 1815. The regiment still exists in the British Army as the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Scotland, and retains many of the proud traditions and values of its forebears.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Foot guards are the best line infantry in the world; every man in their ranks knows it!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men form a superbly disciplined killing machine: a regiment that can fire volley after volley without wavering under any kind of enemy assault. They can reload at speed, charge home with the bayonet and give a very good account of themselves in melee. Their competence and evident morale can inspire nearby troops to fight all the harder. However, like ordinary mortals in line regiments, the Guards will die under artillery bombardment, or if skirmishers start picking them off.\n\nThe Guards regiments are the oldest units in the British army but, in a typically British and contradictory way, they were raised by different sides in the Civil War! The Coldstream Guards were raised in 1650 part of the republican Commonwealth’s New Model Army. The 1st Foot Guards were raised in exile to be Charles II’s bodyguard. The 1st Foot Guards became “Grenadier Guards” after Waterloo in 1815 because they had beaten the French Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard. In fact, they’d driven off another unit, but the honour and name stuck. As the older regiment, the Coldstreamers have the motto “Nulli Secundus” or “second to none”, but the old republicans are still second in the precedence lists after the royalist Grenadier Guards!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite foot guards are charged with the protection of the monarch, the royal family and royal palaces.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are experts with the smoothbore musket, famed for their accuracy and fast reloading skills. They are also famous for their meticulously correct uniforms: the post of foot guard can only be held by the very best soldiers. If necessary the guards must be willing to lay down their lives to protect the royal family. This requires a rare breed of man: highly disciplined with excellent morale, able to stand steadfast to the last. On the battlefield the foot guards set an example to inspire nearby units.\n\nHistorically, monarchies vied with each other to have the finest household guards in their palaces. The French Maison du Roi regiment were hand picked by the king from candidates sent in from every line regiment. Officers who sent along duffers for the duty were punished. In Prussia the “Potsdam Giants” were a quirk of Frederick I’s obsession with very, very tall men and military pomp. Oddly, Frederick was not a very warlike chap at all. He just liked tall men.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Veterans of Napoleon’s Imperial Guard, these men are an elite force of musket-armed soldiers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese highly trained and experienced troops are handpicked by Napoleon and act as part of his personal guard. Taken from the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the Old Guard is made up of the most intimidating soldiers the French army has to offer. Chosen specifically for their physical attributes and notably above average height, these men strike fear into the hearts of Napoleon’s enemies. Their prowess as soldiers is world-renowned and the mere presence of these men on the battlefield can inspire even war weary fellow Frenchmen to fight on.\n\nAfter his dramatic defeat in Russia, Napoleon bid farewell to the Old Guard. These men were his few remaining loyal soldiers but, with no support in Paris, Napoleon was forced to disband them. However, following Napoleon’s return from exile in 1815, they were recalled and marched triumphantly back to Paris with their leader. The end of the Old Guard came at the Battle of Waterloo where they were routed for the first and only time. For many of the French soldiers fighting that day, the retreat of the Old Guard was the end of the battle and the end of Napoleon himself.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Disciplined and inspirational, the men of the Young Guard are elite soldiers of the highest order.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRaised from the ranks of the Imperial Guard, the Young Guard contains the crème de la crème of the new recruits. They inspire surrounding units, encouraging them to fight on in the hope of one day joining the Guard themselves. Unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are exceptionally good. These skills make them an expensive unit. Their only real vulnerabilities are artillery fire and sniping from skirmishers.\n\nHistorically, the Young Guard attracted a number of ambitious young soldiers looking to make a name in battle. One such gentleman was Adolphe Edouard Casimir Joseph Mortier, who joined the army in 1791 as a sub-lieutenant. He took part in a number of key battles during the Revolutionary War, leading Napoleon to place his name high on his first list of Marshals in 1804. Mortier was a huge man, greatly respected by his troops, a fact that proved vital during battles in the Peninsular War, but helped him little at Waterloo when he was unable to join the battle due to severe sciatica. He eventually met his end in 1835 when he and eleven other men were killed by a bomb that was intended for the restored King Louis-Philippe.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These are an elite disciplined force, skilled with muskets and bayonets.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGrenadiers are elite troops, the tallest and strongest men, taking the position of honour on the right of the line during battle. Grenadier Guards have the ability to inspire their fellow soldiers just by their presence. They are incredibly disciplined and can reload their weapons with breathtaking speed and discharge them with high accuracy. Their extensive training makes them more expensive than line infantry.\n\nThe Grenadier Guards have a prestigious history that dates back to the time of Oliver Cromwell and the exile of King Charles II. Charles gathered troops around him in the hope of reclaiming his throne; one of the first of these units was Lord Wentworth’s Regiment of guards. These men remained in France following Charles’ restoration to the English throne, and another regiment was created to protect him, John Russell’s Regiment. Russell’s and Wentworth’s were eventually combined and became known as the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards. Their renown reached a peak at the battle of Waterloo where they were renamed, by royal proclamation, to the 1st or Grenadier Regiment of Foot Guards, because it was believed they had repulsed the Napoleon’s Grenadiers of the Guard.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Powerfully built men, these elite soldiers are recruited from upper class families.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWith a recruitment policy that demands the tallest and strongest men possible, this unit makes an impressive sight on the battlefield. Their presence and reputation has a positive effect on friendly troops, encouraging them on in any dark hours! Unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are almost unrivalled; however, these skills make them an expensive unit; they are also vulnerable, just like lesser men, to artillery and skirmishers.\n\nIn 1809 Napoleon raised two units of Vélites from Turin and Florence in Italy. They were raised from well-to-do families; any man with an income of less than 300 francs was overlooked. This recruitment process was a masterstroke from Napoleon: by recruiting units from the middle and upper classes, and by giving their sons positions of power, he ensured the continued support of the influential classes. He continued to buy support from these people by posting their children to the guard and other units where they would see minimal action but still get to wear a lovely uniform.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The guard comprises of the biggest and bravest men of the Prussian army: an elite force indeed.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Prussian obsession with military drill breeds incredibly disciplined troops, willing and able to follow any order. They are able to load and fire their weapons with an accuracy and speed few can match. Their discipline makes them a deadly foe, and the powerfully built men have an edge over other units in melee. However, these skills make them expensive to recruit, and they are as vulnerable as other men to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers.\n\nThe Prussian army underwent a series of important changes just before and during the Napoleonic era. Gone were the mercenary armies of the past, replaced by a true national army. In 1809 it was decided that a set standard for the movement of battalions was required. The idea of simply placing battalions in line was replaced with a more modern “chequer-board” formation. This was made up of three main elements, the skirmish line, the main battle line and the reserves. The size of these elements varied considerably from battle to battle.</long_description_text>

As with many Prussian line infantry units, these men are incredibly disciplined and trained: this makes for excellent marksmen with fast reloading times, though their close formations leave them vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. Being an elite unit, the regiment is expensive to recruit, but their abilities more than justify the extra cost.\n\nThe 8th Life was one of the most celebrated line infantry units of the Prussian army. During the Napoleonic Wars, the line infantry regiments of the Prussian army outnumbered the newer light infantry regiments. Despite changing tactics the 8th was able to maintain its iron discipline and perform useful service.</long_description_text>

They are considered to be elite as they are chosen for their devotion to the national cause and for their personal courage. This devotion to freedom inspires other nearby troops to fight for their liberty and guards’ morale is almost boundless.\n\nHistorically, this unit had a ceremonial role, in much the same way as a royal or household guard would have in a monarchy, giving protection to the head of state. Their presence at formal occasions added legitimacy to the business of a republic. A republican guard was different from a royal guard in one other respect: it might include political officers, who watched for signs of disloyalty. The “palace guard” sometimes became the only unit a leader could trust when politics got out of hand. It was not unknown for the guard to take the role of “kingmakers”, even in a republic and give their protection to a presidential candidate they liked.</long_description_text>

Their unfailing discipline means these men have excellent accuracy and their reload times are almost unrivalled. These skills do not come cheaply, and their only real vulnerabilities are when facing artillery and wily skirmishers.\n\nHistorically, the Lifeguards were the most ornate unit of the Tsar’s entire army. Hand-picked for looks and stature, they even had their jackets padded around the chest and shoulders to enhance their impressive physiques. Generally recruited from among the nobility, these men soon earned themselves an unfavourable reputation amongst other European nations for their conduct during a banquet held in their honour. Napoleon’s own guards were appalled to see the Russians tearing meat with their hands, draining glasses of wine in one gulp, and even vomiting to make room for further excesses!</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nRecruited in Hungary, these men have an imposing size and impressive skills that are seldom matched by grenadiers of other nations. The Hungarian Grenadiers are a sight to behold on the battlefield in their magnificent uniforms. Not only are they experts in melee and impressive on the charge, but they also display extraordinary marksmanship skills. Their only real vulnerability is artillery fire and, possibly, the danger of being charged from the rear by heavy cavalry. Even under tough circumstances their courage still inspires nearby comrades and encourages them to battle on as well.\n\nHistorically, military enlistment in Austrian service was originally for life, but by 1757 limited service was introduced in the hopes of attracting better recruits and thereby improving the calibre of the soldiers. Men were allowed to enlist for a maximum of six years, or for the duration of any hostilities, whichever was longer. The Hungarian units in the Austrian army were raised by feudal levy. Although the Austrians had an integrated army, and shared a Hapsburg monarch with Hungary, the two nations remained separate kingdoms.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Grenadiers are large, strong men, armed with muskets and a fearsome reputation.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGrenadiers see themselves as elite soldiers, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only large, brave men become grenadiers, this size and strength makes them an impressive sight in a charge. It also gives them an advantage in melee combat. Grenadiers are a proud group and this pride makes for dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter. Like other infantry, they must exercise caution when facing heavy cavalry, but they are also vulnerable to attack from skirmishers.\n\nHistorically, grenadier regiments and battalions began as ad-hoc assault groups. All line infantry regiments had grenadier companies; collecting these sub-units gave commanders a useful group of heavily armed, aggressive and skilful soldiers. Grenadier companies remained in line infantry regiments after the creation of grenadier regiments, but they largely abandoned using grenades: instead, each grenadier company became a “heavy mob” of the biggest and strongest soldiers in a regiment!</long_description_text>

<description_text>The janissaries are professional soldiers, almost born for close combat and powerful in a charge!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese grenadiers are the cream of the Ottoman army, but in comparison to other nations they fight in an old-fashioned way. The Beylik Janissary are unusual because they are grenadiers that still carry grenades. Their relatively small numbers in a unit puts them at a disadvantage against more modern style soldiers, but what they compensate for this lack of numbers by their ferocity. The janissaries are personally brave to the point of foolhardiness; they are given to festooning themselves with weapons and think nothing of hurling themselves into any fight!\n\nHistorically, the corps of janissaries dates back to the 14th Century. They were intended to be a force that was to be completely loyal to the sultan. Boys as young as five were trained and, if necessary, converted to Islam. Janissaries were paid even when not at war, something unheard of in the medieval world! Over time, however, they became bureaucrats and administrators, and this gave them too much power within the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the janissaries’ entrenched position in government and conservative outlook corrupted them. They became a force against any and all change, contributing to the Ottomans’ decline.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nAll grenadiers regard themselves as elite, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only the largest, bravest men can become grenadiers; this size and strength makes them an impressive sight in a charge, and gives them an edge in melee. They are vulnerable when charged by heavy cavalry and when attacked by skirmishers. Those points aside, grenadiers are a proud group and they are dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter.\n\nHistorically, the Prussian army went through a radical reorganisation following Napoleon’s downfall in 1814. In October of that year the six existing grenadier battalions became two regiments and, as a mark of respect, the King of Prussia named these regiments after his allies, Czar Alexander of Russia and Emperor Francis of Austria. The Kaiser Alexander Grenadier Regiment was formed of the 1st and 2nd East Prussian battalions and the Life; the Kaiser Franz regiment was formed of men from the Pomeranian, West Prussian and Silesian battalions.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Powerful in melee, excellent when charging, and incomparable marksmen, these grenadiers are the truly frightening.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are the best of the best: powerful, skilful and deadly. They have proven themselves time and time again in battle and this shows no signs of changing. They excel in melee and the sheer size of the men makes their charge a terrifying sight for even the most experienced soldiers. Talented with a bayonet as well as a musket, they are vulnerable to artillery fire. They must also be wary of heavy cavalry who could take them in a flank.\n\nHistorically, Pavlovsk Grenadiers were instantly recognisable on the battlefield as they retained a more traditional uniform while other units modernised their dress. This was an honour, given to them by Tsar Alexander after their gallant efforts at the Battle of Friedland. They retained the mitre cap that all other infantry units had relinquished, setting them apart and making them one of the most distinctive units of the Napoleonic era. This recognition was well deserved, as their bravery became the stuff of legend. In 1813 they were honoured again when they became part of the Imperial Guard.</long_description_text>

<key>Inf_Irreg_Guerillas</key>
<description_text>These men are not soldiers, but civilians driven to take up arms against their enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGuerrillas are not a recognised military organisation, but bands of comrades and neighbours who have adapted banditry into a way of making war. They fight hard, working in spread out formations that make them difficult for missile troops to hit effectively. They are best when employed in ambush, or as harassing skirmishers. Their “local knowledge” means they are able to hide and appear at will, using their homeland’s hidden places to help fight against invaders. They cannot be expected to fight in carefully dressed lines like disciplined soldiers, and as such are at a disadvantage against well-trained cavalry and infantry.\n\nHistorically, the Spanish people had an enormous capacity for carrying on wars against foreign occupiers long after their rulers had made their peace with an invader. Guerrillas often arose as part of a rebellion; the name is Spanish, and means “little war”. When his men were bogged down, Napoleon described Spain as an “ulcer”, thanks in part to the constant partisan warfare carried on by the guerrillas. They gave the French no peace or safety, even far from the front line.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These irregular troops are poorly equipped and ill disciplined, but they can be a mob of very effective skirmishers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLittle more than a rabble, these men are an erratic and unpredictable enemy for line infantry, and they are good at hiding in a variety of terrain types. They lack the necessary skills to fight well in close combat, instead working better at range, in short, sharp sniping attacks. However, if they are forced into a prolonged exchange of fire with regular light or line infantry they will be the weaker force. Cavalry units also pose a real threat to the azzars, as they lack even basic discipline.\n\nHistorically, Azzars had little to do with standard military protocols, practice, or even organisation, often taking up arms in extraordinary circumstances. The lack of discipline meant that they could sometimes be extremely brutish in their behaviour. It often worked in their favour, in that it gave enemies pause for thought. More typically, however, their lack of discipline counted against them and, when faced with a well-ordered force, they were at a disadvantage. However, their mobility was a boon, allowing them to harass an enemy and withdraw as soon as the fight went against them.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nMore than happy to run headlong into an enemy force with nothing but a sword and bared teeth, the Bashi Bazouks are berserk madmen. When engaged in close combat, they are second to none. Their upkeep and recruitment costs are minimal, making them an ideal unit for those with tight purse strings. However, due to their lack of discipline and firearms they are vulnerable to both cavalry and missile-armed troops.\n\nHistorically, the original Turkish form of “Bashi Bazouk” literally meant “damaged head” or “leaderless”. These men were raised from all over the Ottoman Empire, although they originally came from tribes based in Afghanistan. They were never given uniforms, but did receive their weapons from the Ottoman government. Plunder was their only real payment, and this was considered legitimate by the government. Their lawless ways made them difficult to control and they often had to be forcibly disarmed after taking part in battles. This unpredictable nature gave them a fearsome reputation and other nationalities generally feared them as brutal and savage warriors.</long_description_text>

<key>Inf_Light_Austrian_Grenzers</key>
<description_text>Grenzers are aggressive skirmishers, armed with muskets.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis light infantry unit is used to harass and disrupt the enemy during battle. Like other skirmishers, grenzers consider themselves a cut above most infantrymen. They are expected to show individual aggression, initiative and soldiering skills, not just blindly obey and fight in formation. Their inability to form an effective square formation does leave them vulnerable to cavalry, but their fire accuracy is adequate compensation.\n\nHistorically, the Austrians had a tradition of creating high-quality light forces such as hussars and skirmishers. The grenzers were part of this tradition, recruited from among the Croat and Transylvania population of the Austrian Empire’s domains as frontier guards against the Turks. As frontiersmen, they had a certain air of lawlessness and even banditry, but they proved extremely able light troops. Over time, they became a hybrid type between line infantry and skirmishers: often deployed in battle in the line, but with the ability to skirmish when necessary. As an identifiable infantry nomenclature, grenzers remained in Austrian service until the end of the First World War in 1918.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These versatile light troops are capable of forming an ordered line as well as skirmishing in loose order.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRecruited from the soldiers of the Hanoverian army and armed with muskets, these troops excel at both melee and range combat, where their accuracy and range are nearly unrivalled. This versatility makes them incredibly useful on the battlefield. Their only real vulnerability is when facing cavalry, as they are unable to form square, the standard defence against cavalry charges.\n\nAll of Europe breathed a collective sigh in 1814. The Treaty of Fontainbleau brought an end to hostilities and halted Napoleon’s domination of Europe. The ink was barely dry on this agreement when the British government started to divide up Wellington’s army. Some were sent off to the war in America, others were discharged at home. The King’s German Legion was considered incredibly valuable and escaped this cull. However, all the non-Hanoverian troops were discharged or transferred to other foreign corps. As a result the numbers of the Legion were greatly reduced, leaving only 7,000 in the Legion at Waterloo, but they were all proud sons of Hanover!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light troops are ideal for harassing the enemy from a distance.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light troops are trained to use their surroundings to their advantage, and use skirmish tactics to break and harass the enemy. This British regiment can also form an effective firing line when needed. The accuracy of their fire is excellent but they are weak against well-trained cavalry. Their inability to form square leaves them incredibly vulnerable; prolonged close combat is also inadvisable.\n\nThe British army traditionally recruited its riflemen and light troops from German states, but as France expanded into Holland in 1799, Britain was forced to rethink its recruitment strategy as the north German states were no longer quite so accessible. Many of the foreign troops in British service had perished in the West Indies or been drafted into the 60th Royal Americans. With few light troops available, General John Moore established a camp at Shorncliffe, Kent in 1802 for the instruction of light infantry. It took a year before the first unit of line infantry was converted into a British light infantry regiment.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These men are light infantry, adept at harassing the enemy and screening the main army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese versatile veterans can form a disciplined line to deliver a massed volley, or switch to a loose skirmishing formation to harass and thin out enemy formations. Although their experience in battle means they fire their muskets with a good degree of accuracy, their flexibility also means they lack certain specialised qualities. They are not quite as accurate as other skirmishers nor as devastating as line infantry when firing in volleys. They also lack the ability to form square, which leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\n\nHistorically, the 6th Regiment saw action in over forty battles during the Napoleonic War and were awarded seven battle honours for their achievements. Three of these were given for victories over the Austrians at the battles of Marengo, Ulm and Wagram. The loss at Wagram in 1809 was a particularly devastating blow for the Austrians, breaking their national morale and forcing them to sign a peace treaty that resulted in the loss of a large part of their empire.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Chasseurs, or “hunters”, are light infantry who are excellent at skirmishing and ranged attacks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLight, fast and agile, these men are experts at forming a skirmishing screen, providing diversions for an advance, or rearguard cover for a withdrawal. Armed with muskets, they are equally adept when deployed in line and loose skirmish formations. Their range and accuracy are exemplary, but they lack the skills necessary for close combat; their inability to form square leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\n\nHistorically, Napoleon’s chasseurs included both foot and mounted regiments. The foot regiments were named chasseurs à pied, and the men who served well in them could be rewarded by promotion to the prestigious grenadiers. The cavalry troops were known as the chasseurs à cheval, and had a rivalry with the French hussars. Each unit believed they were superior to the other, and this resulted in many arguments between them over who wore the most dashing clothes or were the better horsemen. Although the hussars had the more expensive uniforms, the chasseurs argued that Napoleon’s escort unit was made up of men from their ranks.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Light infantry are skirmishers who harass the enemy while screening the main body of an army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are versatile soldiers: whether firing in a disciplined line or skirmishing in loose formation, they bring a good self-discipline and accuracy to the battle. They carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but do not rely on massed fire. Instead they aim at individuals within the enemy ranks, killing officers, sergeants and anyone else who takes charge. They also fight their own specialised battle, driving off enemy skirmishers. However, they may prove weak when pitted against line infantry or highly expert skirmishers such as riflemen.\n\nBy the early 1800s, light infantry had a much greater role on the battlefield, at least in Napoleon’s forces. Many armies still saw light infantry as little more than auxiliary troops, choosing to favour the old, tried and tested tactics of massed volley fire and close formations. Napoleon, on the other hand, recognised the advantage flexibility conferred, and used light infantry extensively, to harass enemy lines to pieces, then closing up for a final rush.</long_description_text>

They are skirmishers, used to harass the enemy at long range before concentrating into a tighter formation for a last charge. Their versatility has some disadvantages however, and they may come unstuck against troops trained to specialise in one area of expertise.\n\nHistorically, many of the troops in Napoleon’s Italian army were Polish emigrants, who looked to Revolutionary France for sanctuary and inspiration after the third partition of Poland in 1795. The Polish legions were assembled by Jan Henryk Dabrowski acting for the Cisalpline Republic, a French puppet state. Eventually they became part of the army of the Republic of Lombardy. All, however, were under the command of Bonaparte. Napoleon made his name during his Italian campaign, thanks to his appeal to the common soldiers and brilliant strategies. He had the respect and admiration of his men and even managed to inspire the Army of Italy in 1796, despite the fact that they were under-equipped, underfed and unpaid!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light troops of the Ottomans’ new model army are equipped and trained in the latest Western European fashion.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFighting in a formal way with tight control and disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish troops. The traditional method has involved brave men hurling themselves pell-mell at the enemy with no thought of defeat. The Nizam-I Cedit still fight bravely, but with Western tactics. They have adopted a combination of formations used by Western light infantry, and can switch quickly between skirmishing and a regular firing line.\n\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the repeatedly poor performance of the Ottoman army in battle against Russians. The empire’s inability to defend itself against growing threats was the reason Turkey became known as the “sick man of Europe”. The French Revolutionary Republic, anxious for any allies no matter how unlikely, provided military expertise to the Ottomans. The retraining of the army was not without problems: the janissaries resented their loss of position, privileges and influence.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light infantry are an extremely versatile force, able to skirmish and fight in line.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLiterally translated, cazadores means “hunters” and huntsmen make up a large proportion of the rank and file, along with mountain men of various kinds. Their independent spirits naturally lend themselves to skirmishing. All of these men make their living in the wilds, and are excellent marksmen. However, in close combat or when facing cavalry, the cazadores are disadvantaged.\n\nHistorically, the cazadores were created to replace the light infantry units that had been sent to fight in the French army’s Portuguese Legion. Because the cazadores were a new unit, the Portuguese took the opportunity to give them elite status. Fearing French attacks along the mountainous Spanish border, men familiar with the terrain were the first choice of recruits. Despite problems in finding enough weapons for them, the cazadores went on to garner an impressive reputation, becoming the elite force the Portuguese government so needed.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Fusiliers are an elite light infantry unit, able to form a firing line or skirmish as required.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRigorous training and careful selection of troops have made the fusiliers some of the best soldiers in the Prussian army. The men are armed with smoothbore muskets and bayonets, and drilled to use the most of the tactics of light and line infantry. Their only real weakness is that, when under threat from cavalry, they cannot form square.\n\nThe first battalion of fusiliers for the Prussian army was formally created in 1787. Its origins, however, went back to the “Free Regiments” of the Seven Years War; those units had a reputation for ill-discipline, roguish behaviour and desertion, even at a time when desertion was a common problem. Indeed, desertion remained a problem for many armies, especially among the men conscripted into light skirmishing units. Skirmishers often operate away from direct control by sergeants and officers, and can slip away in the heat of battle, if they really want to desert.</long_description_text>

Although their experience in battle means they have good firepower, the Jägers’ flexibility as a unit has its disadvantages. They are not as accurate as other skirmishers and will not always beat enemy line infantry when firing in volley. They also lack the ability to form square, which leaves them vulnerable to cavalry charges.\n\nDuring 1804-1813, Russia was fighting on two fronts: holding off Napoleon’s troops and fighting a war for territory against the Persians. The Russo-Persian War was an attempt by both sides to consolidate their claims to the same land. Russia was attempting to expand the empire and Persia was attempting to hold on to lands they always considered their own. Because the Russians were also committed against the French, they could not provide a large force to fight the Persians, and instead had to rely on superior technology and tactics to gain an advantage.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light infantry are armed with rifles. As skirmishers, they harass the enemy through accurate sniping.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHard-working and hard-drinking, these hard men are hardened to every conceivable hardship; they are tough, and loyal soldiers to their superior officers. The jägers remain in the Russian army until the day they die, almost as military serfs; most of them were serfs anyway. They have a lifetime of experience of living off the land, and a fearsome reputation for being rather barbaric. Despite this, they are not well suited to the discipline of close combat, and are much more use when peppering an enemy with musket balls.\n\nStrangely, the Tsar’s troops were assigned regiments depending on their physical size. The tallest always became grenadiers, and the smallest were destined for the jäger battalions. But physique is no guarantee of soldierly qualities and in 1811 Field Marshal Barclay de Tolly changed the system so that personal merit and worth determined a man’s assignment. Even more strangely, this practice of “sizing” soldiers went on in the Russian Soviet army as well, but for the practical reason that tall or bulky men simply would not fit into tanks: the design philosophy of Russian tanks was to make them as low as possible, hence the lack of space inside.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These men are exceptionally fine line infantry armed with smoothbore muskets.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe 1st Regiment “Emperor’s Own” is made up of battle-hardened Czech troops, as deadly with their bayonets as they are excellent marksmen. They are best employed in an advance upon the enemy firing volleys before delivering a decisive bayonet charge. To guard against potentially devastating cavalry charges, they can form square, although this leaves them vulnerable to fire from artillery.\n\nHistorically, the Austrian army suffered thanks to the conservative mindset of its military establishment. Rules were handed down to the army from the Hofkriegsrat, the military-civilian administration. At a time when most nations were modernising, choosing less formal formations and making use of light infantry, the dead hand of bureaucracy meant that the Austrian Army could not adapt. Reforms were called for after each defeat, but were thwarted by financial issues. Despite the ineptitude and penny-pinching of national command, the ordinary Austrian soldiers fought on to acquit themselves with bravery and discipline: a surprisingly modern-looking problem for an army of 200 years ago.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The 47th are an experienced and versatile line infantry regiment.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese veteran soldiers are adept at close and fire combat. When formed in a disciplined line, they can unleash a massed volley of fire and then move forwards to engage in melee with the enemy. Their strength in close formation is also one of their weaknesses: they are a large target for artillery or skirmishers. Cavalry charges on the line can be devastating, but the 47th Regiment can form square when required.\n\nIn 1809, the Czech 47th Regiment distinguished itself at the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the first battle Napoleon had personally lost in ten years. Using tactics and tricks such as laying down to minimise casualties from artillery bombardments, the Austrians prevented the French from crossing the Danube. The French would later succeed in crossing on their second attempt at Wagram a few months later.\n\nThe Austrian army consisted of troops from many nations, as the Austrian “empire” was a patchwork of personal fiefs and states. Many Austrian soldiers were technically from the Holy Roman Empire: ruled by Francis II (1768-1835), the Empire included 3 million Czechs until 1806. After that date, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved and Francis became Francis I of Austria. He did manage to hang on to some of the old Empire’s soldiery.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed troops use volleys to break an enemy line, and rely on their discipline to survive any return fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGerman Fusiliers are line infantry who take their title from the fusils, light flintlock muskets, that they carry. Forming the line of battle, they must be able to calmly take aim at their targets as shells explode around them, skirmisher’s shots smack home, and enemy cavalry bear down upon them. Fusiliers are effective against cavalry when in square, and excel in close combat, but care needs to be taken against skirmishers at extreme range.\n\nHistorically, the Austrian army’s infantry was divided into German and Hungarian regiments. The Hungarians were renowned for their ferocity, and the Germans for rigid discipline. This was particularly true of the fusiliers who fought in the rigid formations that made up the bulk of the army. During the Napoleonic Wars, units such as skirmishers, grenadiers and artillery took on more of the fighting as tactics evolved, but the line regiments remained almost unchanged as organisations. Their company and battalion structure still forms the basis of modern armies.</long_description_text>

Whether pushing home a bayonet or forming a disciplined firing line, these men will stand and fight. Like all line infantry, they are vulnerable to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers, but they can quickly counter cavalry charges by forming square.\n\nRaised in 1793, the Connaught Rangers were among the best regiments in Wellington’s army, and distinguished themselves repeatedly in battle. General Picton, their divisional commander, saw them as little more than a plundering rabble and never held back from insulting their Irish roots and Catholic religion. This was probably the result of an unfortunate incident involving two Rangers and a goat. The Rangers caught Wellington’s eye at the Battle of Bussaco in 1810, when he declared that he never witnessed a more gallant charge. They attacked without orders from General Picton who was notably absent from the battle!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These versatile troops form the line of battle, using volley fire to break the enemy before delivering a bayonet charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHighly disciplined and calm in the face of the enemy, these men are well trained in line infantry tactics. They can be relied upon to perform their duties with stolid determination rather than with dash and “fire in their bellies”. Their close ranks can make them vulnerable to artillery bombardment and skirmishers, and they will be ripped apart by heavy cavalry charges if they are in line. To counter this last threat, the unit can be ordered to form square. As long as discipline holds, an infantry unit in square should be able to see off enemy cavalrymen.\n\nThe weapon of the British line infantryman was the famous ‘Brown Bess’; a flintlock musket used, in various guises, from 1730 to 1830. Other nations had their own standard pattern of musket. The Brown Bess used a large heavy ball that would not fit into French muskets, meaning that British ammunition captured on the battlefield was useless. It could be melted down and recast, but not immediately fired at its former owners. The British discovered that, in times of crisis, it was possible to “tap load” a musket by banging the butt on the ground. The bullet was jogged down the barrel, and could then be fired.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nRaised from among the fierce people of the Scottish Highlands, these men are the embodiment of the savagery of their clan forebears and the savage discipline of British marching regiments. They fight well, whether giving fire to an enemy, or the bayonet, and Scottish pride gives them a bloody-minded streak that means they rarely break and run. Like other line regiments, they must adopt square formation when attacked by cavalry.\n\nThe Highland regiments that fought in the Napoleonic Wars were based on the independent companies that were raised to keep order after the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745. The suppression of the rebellion was a brutal business, and the highlanders who joined were brutal, hard men. In regular service, they became solid, dependable and brave: men who could be relied on to fight on, no matter what was happening around them. The 42nd “Black Watch”, for example, held off repeated French assaults at the Battle of Corunna in 1809, giving the British army time to escape from the port.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nWell-trained and well-respected, the foot regiments of the King’s German Legion are responsible for holding the line in battle. When deployed, they brave the threat of artillery fire, skirmishers and cavalry charges to unleash very effective volley fire upon the enemy. Cavalry charges should be countered by ordering them to form square. They fight with justifiable pride in their skills in close combat, giving opponents pause with their brutal use of bayonets.\n\nHistorically, the majority of the King’s German Legion was recruited from the Hanoverian Army, which had disbanded after Napoleon’s occupation of Hanover. Given that the British monarch was also Elector of Hanover, the British lost no time in creating a legion of Hanoverian exiles, ready to fight and die to destroy Napoleon. The British soon held the King’s German Legion in high regard due to their exemplary behaviour on the battlefield and in training. Hanoverian officers had a professional attitude towards war that was largely lacking in their native British counterparts, who considered tactics and drill beneath the notice of proper gentlemen.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThey are an extremely versatile force, and can be relied on to give a good account of themselves in most circumstances. Cavalry will have an extremely hard time breaking any Brunswick square. However, like other line infantry they cannot be left exposed to punishing cannon fire: their bravery and skills are of little use against an artillery bombardment. Like other musket-armed infantry they are vulnerable to skirmishers if their attackers keep under cover and at long range.\n\nBrunswick Infantry fought alongside British troops in the Peninsular War (1810-14). They were organised, armed and equipped in a largely British fashion, as might have been expected: the men came from the “Black Band”, a Brunswicker force that had been evacuated from Germany by the Royal Navy just ahead of an advancing French army. Once reformed and retrained, and then despatched to Spain, the Brunswickers proved their worth time and again as troops who could be relied on to fight, and fight hard. They kept this reputation, and were in the Anglo-Allied army at Waterloo (18 June 1815), gallantly defending the farmhouse of La Haye Sainte against repeated French attacks.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThe 18th Regiment are revered by their fellow countrymen, who know them as “The Brave”. They are experienced soldiers and that makes them valuable on the battlefield. Formed into a line, they can deliver a volley of fire into an enemy, follow it with a decisive charge and then finish the foe in close combat. Brave or not, they are still vulnerable to artillery and sniping by skirmishers. Like other line infantry, they can form square to repulse enemy cavalry.\n\nThe 18th Regiment were at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813, at that time the largest battle to have taken place on European soil. It was also a decisive victory for the forces of the Sixth Coalition, and Napoleon was forced to retreat. This persuaded the smaller German states to join the Coalition. Thanks to Leipzig, the Coalition forces outnumbered the French; apart from anything else, Napoleon had lost his Grande Armée during his failed Russian campaign in 1812. The Coalition further weakened Napoleon’s forces by avoiding battle with the emperor, instead attacking his less able sub-ordinates.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThese infantrymen are convinced that their actions are honourable, just and virtuous in defence of the Revolution and their beloved France. They are the people’s soldiers, buoyed up by high morale and a lack of experience that means they are capable of insane feats of bravery on the battlefield. Strong in numbers, and weak in discipline, they are only a little better than an armed mob, but what a mob! They burn with a zealous conviction that they are right, and this is their weapon even more than the muskets they carry so inexpertly.\n\nBefore 1791, the French army echoed the old feudal system: officers gained their place through family connections and title. The ordinary soldiers were treated badly. A series of mutinies and military rebellions produced some reforms in 1791: a code of justice, a reform of finances and an opening up of the officer class to the lower social classes. But it was the Revolution and the French Guards’ part in storming the Bastille that transformed the army from a tool of repression to the army of the people. The soldiers of the Revolution, though willing, eventually had to come to terms with military discipline, and that would need Napoleon.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed troops use massed volleys to break an enemy, relying on discipline to withstand counter attacks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\n“Marching regiments” or “line battalions” make up the majority of units in most armies. They are so called because they form the line of battle, not because they always deploy in a line. In fact, when faced with a cavalry charge, it is wise to form square for protection. Their strength comes from their close formation which gives them firepower and strength in melee, but this also leaves them vulnerable to artillery and skirmishers.\n\nHistorically, these soldiers carried muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These were inaccurate weapons, effective only over 200 paces or so. They were usually fired in massed volleys to increase the chance of the target being hit! This also meant that the whole unit was busy reloading at the same time. To counter this, the British Army perfected a kind of continuous rolling barrage called platoon fire. A regiment would divide itself into two halves and fire alternately, so that while one “platoon” (the modern use of the word has a different meaning) was firing, the other was loading.</long_description_text>

They are carry swords, and refuse to adopt bayonets, making them more vulnerable to cavalry charges than European troops.\n\nHistorically, the janissaries were the paid “new soldiers” of the sultan, rather than feudal levies. The corps grew so powerful they became a law unto themselves, able to make and break sultans as they saw fit. They were also deeply conservative in the outlook, and jealous of any threats to their position as the Ottomans’ best military force and its bureaucracy. This arrogance eventually lead to their downfall in what became known as the “Auspicious Incident”: Sultan Mahmud II goaded them into yet another revolt, then crushed them.</long_description_text>

They have kept the tradition of Turkish bravery and blended it with the drills and formal tactics practiced by European armies. This includes adopted their Western-style uniforms and bayonets. This makes them effective against enemy cavalry, but they remain vulnerable to artillery fire and the sniping of skirmishers.\n\nThe Nizam-I Cedit was the first westernised infantry in the Ottoman Empire. By the late 18th century the Ottoman army was struggling against modern forces. The janissaries, the Ottoman’s shock troops, had become corrupted and ineffective. This forced Selim III (1761-1808) to establish a “new model” army with help from French military advisors. Though the Nizam-I Cedit proved a success in battle, the corps was disbanded in the aftermath of the Janissary revolt that deposed Selim III.</long_description_text>

This admiration was mutual; the Emperor declared that his Polish Legion infantry were to be treated with the same respect as their French equivalents. The Polish infantry excelled in defensive tactics, choosing to avoid the mass assaults the French favoured. As a result they were less vulnerable to artillery attacks, and were even known to sit down under fire to reduce their vulnerability!</long_description_text>

They can form square to counter cavalry attacks, but are vulnerable to artillery fire when they do so.\n\nSultan Selim III created the Nizam-I Cedit in 1794, an army trained in the Western style, and one that was intended to replace the feudal and janissary troops found in Ottoman armies. The old-style army had been beaten when it faced the Russians, and Selim saw that change was needed. The Nizam-I Cedit proved successful, and a second orta was organised as a mounted militia, recruited from ethnic Turkish peasants. Further expansion of the idea came to naught, as Selim was removed, violently, by a janissary revolt motivated by their resentment of change.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These line infantry soldiers are skilled in giving fire and pressing home an attack with the bayonet, but at the expense of dash and initiative.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nPrussian line infantry revel in the hand-to-hand struggle of a good bayonet charge. They are quite capable of delivering a volley of devastating fire into an enemy with their smoothbore muskets. They have good morale, a legacy of being indoctrinated in their nation’s past glories, but this is no protection against artillery bombardment or the sniping of skirmishers. If threatened by cavalry, they can form square.\n\nIn the years before 1806 the Prussian army had become a little complacent, confident that the glories of the Seven Years War meant that a Prussian soldier was unbeatable. There was no need to change an army that had performed so well. Iron discipline was considered enough to beat any foe. While the immaculately turned out and perfectly drilled Prussians were superficially impressive, they turned out to be inadequate when facing a tactical genius like Napoleon.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Moscow Musketeers are a versatile force of line infantry.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese troops are battle-hardened veterans, making them invaluable on the battlefield. Formed into a disciplined line, they can unleash a massed volley into an enemy then, while the enemy is reeling, follow it with a decisive bayonet charge. For all their experience, they are still vulnerable to fire from artillery or skirmish units, but they can form square to counter potentially murderous cavalry charges.\n\nIn 1812, Napoleon marched his Grand Armée into Moscow, expecting a great victory and abject surrender by Tsar Alexander I. However, the French were hit hard by starvation on the march to Moscow: the foraging that served them well in richer parts of Europe backfired in Russia’s bleak landscape, made more bleak by the Russian habit of burning everything in their path. The French were desperate to find supplies in Moscow, but the Russians continued their denial policy, stripped the city of everything moveable and burned the rest. Robbed of victory and food, the Grand Armée pulled back, and marched into a Russian winter. Napoleon left at least three-quarters of his army, frozen and starved to death, on the steppes.</long_description_text>

They have good morale, but this is no protection against artillery bombardment or the sniping of skirmishers. If threatened by cavalry, they can form square.\n\nBarclay de Tolly, the Russian Minister of War in 1810, instigated a complete re-organisation of the Russian army, to bring it up to date with contemporary tactics. Before him, the army had suffered from the eccentricities of Tsar Paul I, who had reversed, ignored or subverted many of Catherine the Great’s policies. Paul chose to model his army on that of Frederick the Great, an organisation pattern already a quarter-century out of date when he chose it. Among the other madness that Paul inflicted on his poor soldiers was the introduction of steel knee plates; these were not for protection, but to make the soldiers adopt a “proper” stiff-legged marching style!</long_description_text>

They are, of course, vulnerable to artillery fire, and can suffer if left exposed to skirmishers. Against cavalry, they can quickly form square, and then withstand an attack.\n\nThe Swiss have a long tradition of serving in foreign armies, as long as the money was there. The saying “No money, no Swiss” dates back to at least the Renaissance, when Swiss mercenaries were regarded as among the best in Europe. When paid, there were no fiercer soldiers. By the Napoleonic era, Swiss units were exclusive to the French army and the Papal Swiss Guard of the Vatican. At the Battle of Berezina, the Swiss covered the French retreat under fire from the Russians, and this brave service was immortalised in the song “Beresinalied”.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These sword-armed soldiers are professional warriors, the heirs to a centuries’ old tradition of strict training.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe janissaries are the cream of the Ottoman army, but also old fashioned and outmoded by contemporary military forces. They are traditionalists in all things, and this includes making war: they value personal courage and skill, not collective discipline. They are, however, supremely dangerous fighters in close combat and when they charge home.\n\nHistorically, the janissaries were the “new soldiers” of the Ottoman Empire, the replacements for feudal levies and tribal warriors. Janissaries were taken into the corps as children, converted to Islam if necessary, and indoctrinated to fight and die for the Ottoman sultan. They were completely loyal, reliable and efficient, so much so that the Ottoman state came to rely on them as military governors and administrators as well as warriors. This gave them too much power and the new soldiers slowly became the entrenched conservatives who fought any further reforms. Their loyalty was such that they could even rationalise revolt against the sultan, if his policies went against what they considered the best interests of the Ottoman Empire.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops are a rifle-armed militia, and very effective against other militia units.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCynics might describe the Landesschutzen as cannon fodder: they lack prestige, and suffer from low morale as a result. They are denied equipment that other, higher status regular units take for granted. Such a view is wrong. As militia, the Landesschutzen are rather skilful in combat, with good marksmanship skills; they can certainly hold their own against other militia forces, and give careless regular infantry a nasty surprise. As they lack bayonets, they use their rifles as clubs in close combat.\n\nIn 1805 Austria lost the Tyrol to Bavaria, thanks to defeat at the hands of the French and their allies. In 1809 Andreas Hofer, an Austrian nationalist, organised a rebellion against his new masters, took the Tyrol back, and succeeded in capturing Innsbruck not once, but twice. Hofer had been a militia captain in the war against the French, and was a sharpshooter of some skill. A thorn in the side of the French generals, he was tricked, captured, tried and executed by firing squad in 1810, ensuring his place as a hero.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The National Guard is a militia armed with muskets and bayonets, and relatively cheap to recruit.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhen considered against other militias, the National Guard is clearly a superior force. However, they should not be expected to stand against regular military units; they are an armed police force, intended to keep order. In battle, they lack confidence, and may run. They are, however, useful garrison troops, can maintain public order, and are inexpensive to recruit and pay.\n\nThe French National Guard was formed in 1789, a result of “la Grande Peur”, or the “Great Fear”. Failed harvests led to unrest and the National Assembly needed a police force. The Troupes Provinciales were unreliable because they were recruited, by lottery, from the peasantry who were the source of the unrest. The National Guard, on the other hand, attracted the middle classes to its ranks, if only because guardsmen were expected to pay for their own uniforms and equipment. That social difference made them a more reliable force.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Militia are often poorly equipped and trained, but are ideal for maintaining public order.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMen in the militia rarely expect to be sent into battle. It is their lot to act as reserves, or local law enforcers. As a result, if they do find themselves on a battlefield, they should be expected to run away, and not handle their weaponry with any great proficiency. Militia may appear useless, then, but they are cheap to maintain and as plentiful as any bureaucrat could want.\n\nIn 1806, despite previous unfortunate experiences with disgruntled peasants, the Russian state recruited 600,000 serfs into the “opelchenie”, a militia. Training was basic, and weaponry similarly simple: the opelchenie were given pikes. After the French invasion of 1812 the opelchenie was no longer limited to serfs, and another 200,000 recruits joined in a national wave of patriotism. Some of this new cohort of serfs brought their own pitchforks and shovels as weapons. </long_description_text>

<description_text>These militia troops are an ideal garrison force, and can help maintain public order in desert regions.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBecause they lack the status and training of other Ottoman units, Libyan Bedouins are not always as reliable in battle as they might be. They are effective against other militia units, and against rebellious civilians, but should not be expected to last for long against regular army units. On the battlefield, a cynical commander could employ them as a distraction, or to shield his more valuable soldiers.\n\nThe Bedouin were a desert people, toughened by life in the desert; a life on the move bred men who did not need much to survive. Yet they were also known to avoid bloodshed if they could, at least among themselves. Feuding was costly, in both time and blood, and a wise man knew that it was better to talk than to reach for the knife. This same attitude was not always extended to outsiders: raiding and theft from non-Bedouin were honourable ways to support a family.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops are an infantry militia who help maintain public order.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe primary task of auxiliaries is not necessarily to fight on the battlefield, but to intimidate local troublemakers and keep order in the streets. Because of this, they receive little training and, when pitted against regular soldiers, they are likely to run or be killed very quickly. However, for garrison duties and as a diversion on a battlefield they can be useful to a cunning commander.\n\nIn 1799 Napoleon besieged the Ottoman city of Acre in Palestine, echoing the Crusades that had taken place 700 years earlier. For once, Napoleon lacked artillery as British forces had ambushed it en route. His infantry would have to take Acre unsupported. After many attempts, new artillery was brought up and broke down the wall, only to reveal that the Ottomans had built an inner wall to seal the breach! After two months of failure and disease, Napoleon admitted defeat and withdrew his exhausted soldiers.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These men are dragged from the fields, perhaps given muskets, and then herded in the direction of the enemy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEven though they carry muskets, they are given only the most basic of training: just enough so that they will not actually kill themselves before they reach a battlefield. This inexperience and a fatalistic attitude towards survival mean that they have low morale even before the firing starts. They can, just, hold their own against militia units, but expecting much more of them is a little optimistic. They can be a useful way of getting the enemy to waste precious shot and gunpowder.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire had several different types of conscripted levies in its armies: “miri-askeris” were paid on the battlefield, for example, while the “yeri-neferats”, included every Muslim man, regardless of age, in a town under threat. The intention was to get as many people onto a battlefield as quickly as possible as a response, any kind of response, to an enemy incursion.</long_description_text>

These are the people-in-arms, not a hardened force of veterans. Against well-handled and disciplined soldiers, they will suffer heavy losses. They are, however, a useful force of garrison troops, and can help keep order at relatively low cost.\n\nIn 1812 Prussia had been compelled to aid Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. General Yorck, the officer in charge of the Prussian Auxiliary Corps, was a well-respected patriot, and an experienced soldier. It was obvious to him that the French were going to be defeated, so he declared his corps neutral and aided the Russians in taking East Prussia. As East Prussia, if not the whole country, was at war with France, an army was needed to defend it and the result was the recruitment of a large body of Landwehr militia. Yorck’s decision to defy the French produced the Russo-Prussian alliance of 1813, a significant bloc against Napoleon’s France.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nArmed citizenry are a mob, given whatever guns are to hand, with brief training that the muzzle end is to be pointed towards the foe. Weapons do not make soldiers, and arming the people is an act of desperation. On the battlefield, the citizenry are unlikely to do much to damage an enemy, but the size of the mob can at least cause the foe problems. This can give real soldiers enough time to win the battle, or make the enemy pay heavily for their victory.\n\nHistorically, arming the people was something that really scared the authorities in every nation, particularly if the population hated the existing regime. It was not wise to supply an angry population with weapons, when these might be turned on the rulers, rather than foreigners. When Austria decided to create landwehr or militia forces, it was careful to exclude many regions from the decision as the loyalty of Austria’s many different ethnic groups could not always be guaranteed.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nRecruited from woodsmen, hunters and poachers, these men are used to moving across broken ground and staying unobserved by their prey. Their cleverly designed airguns can be reloaded very quickly by screwing in a new air reservoir and slotting home a new magazine of shot. The airgun is also rifled, making it a deadly weapon at long range. However, like all skirmishers the Windbüchse Jägers are vulnerable to being ridden down by cavalry and cannot be expected to last long against the massed fire of line infantry.\n\nHistorically, the windbüchse (“wind rifle”) was a fascinating “what if” of military history. It had a 20-round magazine, and could fire as quickly as the user could pull the trigger. The gun could drive a ball through a plank (or a man) at 100 paces, but it was a delicate weapon. Quiet, and without a tell-tale cloud of gunpowder smoke, the windbüchse did not work after rough treatment, something that was inevitable in battle. Napoleon Bonaparte hated them and decreed that any captured “assassin” with an airgun was to be executed, not treated as a soldier.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Armed with a tough, accurate rifled musket, the Rifles are an elite skirmishing force.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe rifle gives them the ability to kill at astonishing ranges for a flintlock weapon. Their skills and skirmishing tactics allow them to use whatever cover is to hand to hide, stalk the enemy, and then kill them from a distance. Even their uniforms are a subdued colour to help them in their role as hunters and snipers.\n\nThey are, however, not invulnerable. Like all skirmishers, they can be cut down by a carefully timed cavalry charge. They will also suffer disproportionate casualties if exposed to a line unit’s firepower.\n\nHistorically, the Greenjackets, nicknamed for their dark green uniforms that blended into the landscape, carried an infantry rifle designed by Ezekiel Baker of London. This muzzle-loading flintlock used a small ball in a rifled barrel with superb accuracy. Loading was a slow business, and could take a minute or more to do properly so that a shot would fly true. The result, in the hands of an expert, was deadly. French officers came to dread the presence of the Rifles on a battlefield.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed skirmishers are exceptionally good at using available cover, making them useful for ambushes.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nSkirmishers fight two battles: one against the enemy’s skirmishers to prevent them from doing their worst, and the second to harass the main body of the enemy army. Voltigeurs are excellent shots, even with their smoothbore muskets, and can whittle down the numbers of enemies they face very quickly. They are also well trained in using every scrap of cover and every fold in the landscape to hide. This makes them hard to spot and worse, hard to kill.\n\nAt the start of the Napoleonic period, most armies thought of light troops as auxiliaries to the line infantry. Part of Napoleon’s genius lay in taking existing ideas and making them work really well: he got the proportions of light and line troops right for his armies, and made sure that his attacking columns were well supported by swarms of skirmishers, including voltigeurs. Originally, the name had come about because they were expected to jump onto enemy cavalry horses and attack the riders that way! This was nonsense, but the voltigeurs did prove excellent soldiers. They were also given additional tasks, such as aiding pontonniers in building bridges; they could not only work hard, but also fight effectively to defend the bridge if necessary.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These skirmishers are excellent shots, perfect for harassing an enemy from a distance.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nNothing causes fear in men during battle like seeing your comrades slaughtered by a seemingly invisible enemy. Jägers are adept at hiding in cover as the foe approaches and they then use their superior marksmanship to bring down their targets. Using loose skirmishing formations, jägers are good at ambushes, but are at a disadvantage if they are forced into close combat, or ridden down by cavalry.\n\nThe Austrian Jägers, or “hunters” were extremely well trained and particularly adept at using cover and fieldcraft to gain the upper hand in a fight. They could stalk their targets, just as hunters stalk deer, using every bit of cover to hide their approach to a firing position. At the Battle of Wagram in 1809 jägers hid in a drainage ditch and lay in wait for the French, hitting them with a barrage of well-aimed shots.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops of the “new model” army are armed, equipped and trained in the latest European fashion.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFighting in formal order with disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish forces: the traditional method simply involved brave, heavily armed men hurling themselves at the enemy. This “new model” army is a break with the past, and it has even adopted Western-style military dress. Despite these modernisations the Nizam-I Cedit remain vulnerable to cavalry charges and when in prolonged close combat. They are best used in a loose skirmish formation, where their marksmanship and rifles can be used to the full.\n\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the poor performance of Ottoman armies against the Russians. The Ottomans’ inability to defend their empire against a growing Slavic threat, and predatory moves by other European powers, were reason enough for Turkey to be known as the “sick man of Europe”. Help came from an unlikely source: anxious for allies, the French Revolutionary Republic provided much of the expertise to retrain the Ottoman army. However, the reforms met with opposition from the ultra-conservative janissaries; eventually the janissaries had to be disbanded.</long_description_text>

<key>Inf_Skirm_Norwegian_Ski_Troops</key>
<description_text>These men are a superb force of crack marksmen, able to hit targets with almost supernatural accuracy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTheir skis are the perfect way of moving across a snowy landscape at speed, although it is often easier, and stealthier, to walk into battle. Mobility allows these soldiers to quickly select good firing positions and then make full use of their sniping skills, honed over years of hunting. Their hunting experience allows them to hide in plain sight and their loose formation provides them with a small amount of protection from enemy missile troops.\n\nHistorically, the rifle was an expensive item to manufacture, as the barrel required careful machining to create the grooves that impart spin to the bullet; smoothbore weapons were nowhere near as difficult to make. A rifled barrel, however, would shoot further and with more accuracy than any smoothbore.\n\nSki-ing as a tool of warfare has a long history in Scandinavia, being first mentioned in the 13th Century works of Saxo Grammaticus, the Danish historian and antiquary. Ski troops were able to cover vast distances at speed in wintertime, giving them strategic mobility, and yet remain fresh enough to fight a battle.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Sharpshooters and expert woodsmen all, the Tiradores are Portugal’s elite rifle corps.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nArmed with rifles and an excellent knowledge of fieldcraft, Tiradores could shoot the cockade off a dragoon at 100 paces. “Tiradores” is Portuguese for sharpshooters and nothing describes these men better. They fight in loose formation and are ideal for harassing the enemy from a distance, using their ability to hide in all kinds of terrain. However, should these men be drawn into close combat they will suffer heavy losses. Any contact with cavalry could prove disastrous.\n\nIn 1808, as Napoleon continued to dominate Europe, Portugal found that it was totally without regular light infantry units. Those that had been raised with the all-arms light corps in 1796 had been drafted into the French army’s Portuguese Legion. New light infantry would need to be recruited, equipped and trained from nothing. These new light infantry were called “Caçadores”, the Portuguese for hunters, and within each battalion were four companies of ordinary Cazadores and one company of elite “Tiradores”.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Elite rifle-armed troops, these men are crack shots and skilled in skirmish warfare.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nNamed for the province in which they are raised, Silesian Schuetzen are elite sharpshooters. These troops can hide completely in a variety of terrain types and fire upon the enemy with startling accuracy. They fight in loose formation, which gives them added protection from line infantry. If they meet the same units in open conflict, these skirmishers will suffer. The Silesian Schuetzen are also at a disadvantage in close combat.\n\nHistorically, Schuetzen units were raised from a variety of sources to defend Silesia from the French attack of 1807. They were originally garrisoned in Liegnitz and, like many units in their early years, they lacked uniformity of armament, though mostly they were armed with infantry muskets. Eventually the men were all armed with the 1787 pattern rifle, a long gun with a calibre of about a finger’s width. Unusually for a flintlock, it had front and back sights: the back sight was graded up to 300 paces, allowing startling feats of marksmanship.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Armed with muskets and swords, these soldiers are can fight mounted and on foot.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe primary duty of the mounted Nizam-I Cedit is to harass the enemy and pick off important individuals within their ranks. The speed provided by their mounts mean these men can reach areas of the battlefield significantly quicker than their counterparts on foot. However, their speed and versatility is no protection if they find themselves in close combat; if pitted against line infantry they will suffer heavy losses.\n\nHistorically, the mounted Nizam-I Cedit were known as the Neferi Nizam-I Cedit, or the 2nd Orta provincial militia. Shortly after being raised, the 1st Orta felt the wrath of the British Ambassador, who was angered by the fact that the units of this new model army were issued with French instead of British muskets! His displeasure was the least of their problems. Although sanctioned by the sultan, the modernisation of the army was met with hostility from Ottoman traditionalists. The bayonet, for example, was a serious bone of contention: many chose to see it as a way of reducing proud warriors to little more than parts in a machine.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Mounted Riflemen are skirmishers and snipers without peer, picking off leaders to sow confusion in enemy ranks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOrganised and equipped as light infantry with muskets and horses as mounts, these riflemen see themselves as an elite force. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they fight without close supervision from their officers. Their uniforms set them apart in an age when soldiers dress like peacocks: they deliberately blend into the landscape, firing on the enemy from the safety of the undergrowth. If these men are forced into close combat they will suffer heavy losses, but their ability to fire both mounted and on foot makes up for this shortcoming.\n\nHistorically, the most famous riflemen, the British Greenjackets, carried infantry rifles designed by Ezekiel Baker. This muzzle-loading flintlock fired a small ball from a tightly rifled barrel to give superb accuracy, with accounts of riflemen holding targets for each other at more than a hundred paces! It was a slow business to load the piece properly and could take a minute or more to do properly, but the resulting shot was deadly over astonishing ranges. Baker even carefully supplied a long “sword bayonet” so that the overall length of his rifle plus bayonet matched that of a line infantryman’s bayonet-tipped musket.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These mounted light infantry help to slow the enemy advance and keep their own line untroubled by enemy skirmishers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy ranks. Unlike their comrades in the line and light infantry, they are mounted and can fight on foot if needed. They form up in a loose skirmish line, firing independently at their self-designated targets. The result is a constant barrage rather than a devastating volley, but a deadly one as officers and sergeants are removed from the fight.\n\nHistorically, Cazadores were trained to defend the border between Spain and Portugal, an area of much activity before and during the Peninsular War. In 1800, Napoleon and his Spanish ally, Manuel de Gordoy, demanded that Portugal ally with France. This was something that Portugal, a long-standing ally of the British, refused to do. In 1801 French and Spanish troops under Gordoy took the Portuguese town of Olivenza. Once the fighting was over, Gordoy picked oranges from a nearby grove and sent them back to the Queen to inform her of his victory, giving the affair the title of “The War of the Oranges”.</long_description_text>

<description_text>As mounted skirmishers these men harass the enemy and screen the main body of an army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAlong with their horses, initiative, aggression and pace mark these men out from other infantry. Mounted Jägers carry standard smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but they do not rely on massed volley fire: they deliberately aim at individuals within the enemy ranks. This unsporting and selective fire can be delivered on foot or from horseback. It can disrupt enemy formations or drive off enemy skirmishers. These men are trained to shoot, not fight in hand-to-hand battles, and will be worsted in a melee.\n\nHessian mercenary Captain Johann Ewald was a field commander of the Jäger corps and a prolific writer. He documented his life as a soldier during the American Revolution and created maps of the areas he spent time in, with detailed information about the placement of troops and fortifications. Ewald was the son of a bookseller and began his military career at the age of sixteen, quickly attaining the rank of captain and given command of a group of Jägers. After taking part in several key battles during the American Revolution, it became apparent that Ewald had progressed as far as his social class would allow and he decided to join the Danish army, where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.</long_description_text>

<key>Small_Brig</key>
<description_text>A brig is a lightly-armed, two-masted sailing ship, with exceptional handling and sailing qualities.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIn the hands of a good master, a brig is a handy little ship, and can almost turn in its own length. The square-rigged sails allow precise control. A good helmsman can swiftly bob in and out of range of larger, deadlier ships whose cannons could demolish the brig’s weak hull. This manoeuvrability makes up for the light armament, which consists of only 6-pounder cannons, which have little real firepower in naval terms.\n\nHistorically, the United States Navy favoured brigs, particularly on the Great Lakes. Brigs, like the USS Argus, also gave a brave account of themselves against the Barbary Pirates along the North African coast. United States traders had suffered at the hands of the pirates after the Revolution; the Barbary Pirates had an agreement to leave British and British colonial ships alone, but after the successful rebellion, they considered the newly-flagged American ships to be fair game. Today, a brig is more commonly understood to be a ship’s prison cells, a usage that is probably due to the US Navy’s use of brigs as prison hulks.</long_description_text>

<key>Small_French_Corvette</key>
<description_text>Corvettes are small warships, handy to sail, and armed with a small number of 9-pounder guns.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTheir size makes them ideal as a “skirmisher” against sloops and brigs, as they have the speed to keep up and the cannon range to do damage. They will not last long, however, against a larger vessel such as a ship-of-the-line: one broadside at close range from a rated ship would likely dash any corvette to pieces.\n\nCorvettes were a two-masted, French design for a ship very similar to a sloop-of-war; slightly smaller than a frigate with only a single gun deck. Like many French vessels, they were well thought out and beautifully constructed, with good sea-handling characteristics. Corvettes were ideal for the inshore waters along the English Channel where good sailing qualities were required. Other nations counted themselves fortunate if they took a French-built corvette as a prize. The term “corvette” was revived by many navies a century later for smaller warships. Indeed, a large number of modern navies use &quot;corvette captain&quot; (Korvettenkapitän, for example, in the Deutsche Marine) as a rank title, one step-up from lieutenant, indicating an officer suitable for an independent command.</long_description_text>

<key>Small_Galley</key>
<description_text>A galley does not rely solely on the wind to move: banks of oars and rowers below deck make it manoeuvrable and handy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIt is also heavily-armed, with 42-pounder cannons giving it a formidable weight of shot for each volley. It can also move directly into the wind, and even turn on the spot if the rowers on one side of the ship back water while their companions continue to row normally. These handy sailing qualities come at a price, though:  the large crew of rowers are vulnerable to grapeshot; the hull and oars are weak compared to a ship of the line.\n\nGalleys tended to be employed in relatively sheltered waters, and close to a friendly port, the second due to the large crew of rowers. The life of a rower can be brutal and short. Some countries use criminals at the oars, and these men are chained to the ship to prevent escape. If the ship goes down, however, the rowers perish with it. They are always confined below the fighting platform of the ship, and are in danger from grapeshot and broken oars. Indeed, a good raking with grapeshot will cripple a galley as surely as firing chainshot into the masts of a sailing vessel.</long_description_text>

<key>Small_Sloop</key>
<description_text>A sloop-of-war is a very manoeuvrable sailing vessel, with enough firepower to sting larger opponents at the very least.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nSpeed is the sloop’s weapon: a ketch-rigged sloop is capable of sailing very close to the wind, far closer indeed than many larger ships. This ability allows it to stay out of trouble, most of the time, if under a competent master. This is fortunate, as a sloop does not have the weight of shot, being armed with relatively light six-pounder cannon; or structural strength to last very long against a real battleship.\n\nA sloop was hardly ever the command of a post-captain, a man who was on the permanent list of naval officers. The commanding officer of a sloop was called “captain”, at least to his face, but his official title was usually “master and commander”; his rank, and pay, was that of lowly lieutenant. Commander as a naval rank, as opposed to job title, was a later development. This is why, somewhat confusingly to civilians, a naval commander is outranked by a naval captain, and it is still something that baffles Hollywood scriptwriters from time to time. Command of a sloop, however, was a chance for a young officer to get away from stuffy superiors and to shine in his own right as an aggressive and successful leader.</long_description_text>

<key>Special_Bomb_Ketch</key>
<description_text>This is a small, two-masted ketch-rigged vessel, adapted to carry a single large mortar upon its forward deck.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\n All sailing ships rely on having their masts and sails in positions that give them a balanced and evenly weighted push from the wind. Bomb ketches are not handy sailing vessels, thanks to their compromised rigging and the weight of the mortar and its mounting. The design needs to keep the forward portion of the ship clear for firing the mortar.\n\nThe strength of a bomb is in its mortar. This can throw an explosive shell high into the air to plunge down on enemies. The fact that the shell is explosive rather than solid adds to its deadly qualities: men and structures are equally shredded by the arrival of a shell.\n\nDuty aboard a “bomb” was not an enviable posting, and there was a good reason why bomb ketches were named after volcanoes, fire-gods or fearsome ideas. They had a nasty tendency to explode, thanks to the shells that they carried; fire aboard a mortar was far more dangerous than aboard any other type of sailing ship, as the ammunition as well as the propellant powder could go up! Despite this, all navies found them a useful ship to have, and the original French design was soon copied by all the sea-going European powers.</long_description_text>

<key>Special_Rocket_Ship</key>
<description_text>A rocket ship is a floating battery, able to set any enemy vessel afire with a horrendous bombardment.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe ship is entirely given over to the business of launch ramps and rocket stands. Given that rockets are horribly inaccurate, the most effective way of using them is to fire a great many at a single target all at once. Such a peppering with rockets, some of which may still be burning, can cause a target to catch fire or even explode. There is also a risk of explosion aboard the rocket ship and, because of this inherent danger, most navies see little point in using good quality hulls to mount rockets. There is little need to reinforce the fabric of the ship, because the rockets do not create much recoil, but rigging chains (not ropes) and wetted sails are standard to reduce the risk of fire.\n\nMilitary rockets in Europe were the result of some very nasty surprises suffered by European troops in India, where rockets had long been used in warfare. In Britain, Congreve’s rockets were direct copies of Indian weapons although this made them no less fearsome. Rockets were made with all kinds of warheads from simple spears to explosive shells; proposals were even put forward for a variety of war gasses and chemicals, although these were rejected as barbarous and un-Christian by every government. On ships, explosive heads were preferred, as these did the most damage to wooden targets.</long_description_text>

<key>Steam_Ship_38</key>
<description_text>A steam-powered ship is not at the mercy of the wind, a valuable attribute for any admiral.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBy fitting a steam engine and all its machinery into an existing hull, naval architects created a small ship-of-the-line not entirely tied to the wind and tide. The results are moderately successful, as a steamship can sail independently of the wind, but still spend a good deal of time under sail to save fuel. Tactically, however, the steamship has another advantage: manoeuvrability. The 38 guns aboard can be brought to bear with ease.\n\nHistorically, steam shipbuilding owes a great debt to the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a man who built ships, bridges and railways. His first ship, the SS Great Western, made 74 Atlantic crossings during its life. Not content with this, Brunel designed and built an iron, screw-driven “liner”, the SS Great Britain. The first screw-driven ship to cross the Atlantic, she is now splendidly restored and preserved at Bristol Docks in England.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A steamship has sails but the engine gives it the tactical ability to ignore the wind in battle.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBy having a good weight of broadside that can be brought to bear regardless of wind conditions, this 80-gun ship is a significant force in any fleet. The ability to sail directly into the wind is something that no sail-powered vessel can ever match.\n\nThe idea of going into battle with a fire raging in his ship’s belly was not one that appeals to every captain. Fire was always a risk aboard a wooden vessel, and boiler explosions were not unknown. There was also the problem of coaling stations: while these ships carried sails, they did need regular supplies of coal. Steam was a tactical advantage, not a strategic one.\n\nHistorically, the first British ship to be designed and built from scratch to use steam was HMS Agamemnon, laid down in 1852; previous steam warships were conversions from sailing ships-of-the-line. Agamemnon was fitted with sails and carried 91 guns. She also had a short career as the Navy’s pride and joy, as she was paid off in 1862. She did, however, help lay the first Transatlantic telegraph cable in 1857-8.</long_description_text>

A thick outer skin of iron is riveted to a conventional wooden hull, and the two layers can defeat most solid shot except at very close range. Combined with a steamship’s ability to ignore the wind and go where the captain wills, this makes an ironclad a formidable opponent. This power is not without risk, though, as a boiler explosion will rip out the heart of any steamship.\n\nHistorically, ironclads first saw action during the American Civil War (1861-65). During the Battle of Hampton Road CSS Virginia made short work of the wooden ships in the river, but an encounter next day with USS Monitor ended inconclusively, as neither ship could knock out the other. These vessels were not, however, the first ironclad warships; they were heavy river gunboats or monitors, and almost incapable of going to sea. The first ocean-going ironclad warships were HMS Warrior and the French Navy’s La Gloire, launched during yet another arms race between Britain and France. Warrior was launched specifically to steal French thunder and make their ship obsolete, being commissioned and built while the French vessel was still on the slipway.</long_description_text>

<key>Steam_Ship_Frigate</key>
<description_text>Quick and manoeuvrable, this frigate can sail against the wind thanks to its two enormous paddle wheels.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCarrying powerful 32-pounder cannon, this frigate is a valuable asset to any admiral. At close range, her guns fire a powerful broadside, but this does not make her invulnerable. No frigate has a hull that can withstand a broadside from a ship-of-the-line, and in this case the paddle wheels are vulnerable too. While a paddle-wheel powered frigate is not entirely at the mercy of the wind, it is not possible to carry enough fuel to cruise over long distances; steam is a tactical advantage, not a strategic one.\n\nPaddle wheels were a logical reversal of the idea of a waterwheel, simply reversing the idea of the water flowing past the wheel and providing energy. They were originally used in river-going craft, and it was not until 1819 that the first seafaring paddle-wheel ship, SS Savannah, made the first steam-powered crossing of the Atlantic, from Savannah, Georgia, to Liverpool in England. Savannah did run out of fuel off Ireland, but eventually made landfall and then, after refitting, pressed on to St. Petersburg in Russia, where the Tsar&apos;s government was so impressed that it made a cash offer for the ship. The valuation wasn’t good enough.</long_description_text>

<key>Trade_Ship_Dhow</key>
<description_text>A dhow is a traditional Arab vessel, with a lateen sail. It is armed, but is primarily a trade ship.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough an ancient design, the dhow is an efficient craft and can be run very cheaply, allowing profit from trade to pour into the owner’s purse! Trade can be treacherous business on the high seas, and for this reason the dhow is armed with a small number of guns so the crew can protect themselves from pirates. However, the dhow is not a warship in any way; the crew are interested in survival, not glory. A trade dhow will never be a match for any warship.\n\nHistorically, Europeans tended to use the term “dhow” indiscriminately to mean any vessel rigged with lateen sails, although a Middle Eastern sailor would see such a generalisation as very crude and simplistic. Lateen sails were triangular and set at an angle to the ships mast, which made them manoeuvrable but somewhat difficult in stormy conditions. The dhow was used throughout the Arab world for trade and piracy, honest men and thieves favouring the craft for its good handling and relatively high speed.</long_description_text>

<key>Trade_Ship_Indiaman</key>
<description_text>The Indiaman is an armed merchant ship, built for trade between Europe and the East. It can defend itself in need.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nUnusually for a merchant ship, an Indiaman carries cargo, passengers, and a good number of guns. Intended to sail from Europe to the other side of the world and back carrying valuable, even priceless, cargoes, these ships have to be able to defend themselves. The Indiaman’s 9- and 18-pounders are sufficient to fight off smaller attackers, but it is vulnerable to boarding. Carrying a cargo does not help its speed either, and the added guns mean the upkeep has an impact on any profit made. However, a defendable trade ship is always more profitable than stolen goods or kidnapped passengers.\n\nHistorically, East Indiamen resembled ships of the line, both in their general configuration and paintwork. At the Battle of Pulo Aura (1804), the ambiguous appearance and aggressive handling of a squadron of British Indiamen completely humbugged the French admiral, Charles-Alexandre Linois. He withdrew in the face of “superior” forces. Commodore Nathaniel Dance, of the British Company fleet, received a knighthood and a handsome reward for his cunning.</long_description_text>

<key>Trade_Ship_Merchantmen</key>
<description_text>The merchantman is built for trade, although it does carry a few light guns for defence.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis trade ship is neither blessed with speed nor firepower and can be outmanoeuvred by most naval vessels. It is built for trade, and its low upkeep costs mean a large profit from each journey. If trapped it can defend itself slightly and maybe even drive off very weak attackers, but merchants are not fighting men, and their low morale and the ship’s light guns are unlikely to last long against a real warship.\n\nBritish merchant trading was the strongest in the world during the Napoleonic era, and this position was protected by the Navigation Acts first passed in 1651. Trade with British colonies had to be carried out using “British bottoms” or British ships, not to mention British ports and mainly British crews, effectively squeezing out any competition. Other nations tried similar protectionist policies, but without as much success. Despite this legal help, British merchant owners were not without their difficulties; the Royal Navy used press gangs to recruit seamen for the ranks and experienced merchant sailors were the first to be targeted, forcing merchant owners to pay high wages for less able seamen simply to run their ships.</long_description_text>

<key>Cav_Heavy_French_Empress_Dragoons</key>
<description_text>The Empress Dragoons are an elite unit within the elite Imperial Guard, an exceptionally effective heavy cavalry force.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTheir charge is almost irresistible, and they can fight effectively in melee with their heavy cavalry swords, but they should not be thrown away against infantry squares. Even against other cavalry, they can give a very good account of themselves. They are, however, relatively slow moving and should not be used to pursue fleeing foes. The Empress Dragoons can fight on foot, if needed, using their carbines, but they are not particularly effective as an infantry unit.\n\nUnder Napoleon the Imperial Guard gradually became an almost separate army; it had infantry, artillery, and cavalry components, and even its own elite units within the already-elite Guard. By any standards, the Empress Dragoons, named to honour Josàphine de Beauharnais, were an elite force. All the officers were appointed personally by Napoleon, and the rankers had to have served at least 10 years in the saddle before they were allowed to join. Every chasseur and dragoon regiment of the line in the French army had its best non-commissioned officers taken. While this undoubtedly made sure the Empress Dragoons was composed of the best of the best, it almost certainly damaged the rest of the army by removing those same veterans from their original units.</long_description_text>

<description_text>An elite and disciplined force, Dutch Grenadiers are skilled with muskets and with bayonets in close combat.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDutch Grenadiers see themselves as elite soldiers and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. This sense of inherent worth helps to inspire other soldiers and instils a sense of pride in the troops. They are incredibly disciplined and can reload their weapons at breathtaking speed, discharging them with relatively good accuracy. Their extensive training makes them more expensive to raise than other infantry units but, like all foot soldiers, they must exercise sensible caution when facing heavy cavalry and skirmishers.\n\nThe Dutch Grenadiers became part of Napoleon’s army following his 1810 annexation of Holland. At that time they were the Dutch Royal Grenadiers, and the men of this regiment entered Paris in August of 1810. Napoleon reviewed the troops personally and was very impressed by the fine appearance of the men. They wore white coats faced with crimson, instead of the traditional dark blue worn by other senior regiments (later other units wore white, but this was because the British blockade affected dye supplies). The Guard Grenadiers were not as impressed however, and the first meeting of these two regiments ended in a near-riot. Their behaviour was so appalling that they were forced to apologise to the general public for their rowdy and drunken antics.</long_description_text>

<key>Inf_Elite_French_Guard_Seamen</key>
<description_text>Disciplined and ready for anything, the Guard Seamen are an elite unit in every sense of the word.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe ranks of the Guard Seamen are filled with the best soldiers the French army has to offer. Chosen for their imposing height, good conduct and loyalty, these men have excellent morale and a positive effect on the morale of nearby friendly units. Their discipline is exemplary; their reload times and the accuracy of their musketry are the envy of many. They do have some weaknesses: their extensive training and experience makes them more expensive than most foot troops, and they perform poorly against artillery and skirmishers that stay beyond their musket fire.\n\nHistorically, the Seamen of the Guard were formed as a result of a decree by Napoleon. They were originally intended for action as part of the planned invasion of Britain, but when these plans were put aside they took a place in the Imperial Guard. In a few short years these men had developed a wide variety of skills that made them indispensible to the Emperor. He commented that “When occasion required they proved equally valuable whether as sailors, soldiers, artillerymen or engineers; there was no duty they could not undertake.”</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Guard Chasseurs à Cheval are fine horsemen, skilled in melee combat and harassing the enemy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light cavalrymen carry swords and carbines, but they are not expected to charge home, instead they are a superb force to disrupt enemy plans and pursue the routing foes. They are, for example, incredibly effective against skirmishers and artillery. Their horses have good endurance and are fast: a cavalryman without his horse is, after all, fairly useless. They are vulnerable when facing heavier cavalry and well-trained infantry in square, but they can fire their carbines when mounted.\n\nThe Guard Chasseurs à Cheval, Napoleon’s closest guards, had their origins on the battlefields of northern Italy and the “Guides” that Napoleon raised there. When the regiment was officially constituted in 1800 it had four officers and 113 men, all chosen from among the Guides and other veterans of the Italian campaign. Napoleon’s respect for his regiment was obvious and he was often seen wearing the green undress uniform of the chasseurs. These men followed Napoleon from Arcola to Waterloo, and remained loyal to him even in his exile. Few Chasseurs consented to serve under the restored Bourbons when the Emperor finally abdicated.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Polish Guard Lancers are fearsome and lightning fast at the charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTrained to ride hard into battle with their lances couched, these superb horsemen are ideal shock troops. Their steeds are fast and carry them to key points on the battlefield in what seems like a heartbeat. The morale of these brave men is unrivalled, but should they become caught in a prolonged melee their weakness in close combat will become apparent. Employed against elite infantry formed in square their charge and lance skills will be largely wasted.\n\nThe Polish Guard were originally raised from among a party of exiled Polish noblemen who accompanied Napoleon into Warsaw in 1807. He was so impressed with the loyalty of these men that he insisted the new regiment be attached to his own Imperial Guard. From that moment on candidates for the regiment had to be Polish landowners between the ages of 18 and 40; they were expected to provide their own horses and equipment. It wasn’t until after the Battle of Wagram in 1809 that these men were issued with the lance as standard equipment. When Napoleon was forced exiled on Elba in 1814, 150 loyalists of the Polish Guard Lancers followed their Emperor to prison.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Proud horsemen, Dutch Guard Lancers are fast moving and powerful when charging.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTrained to ride hard into battle with their lances down, these superb horsemen are ideal shock troops: the moment of impact is the moment of truth for their attack. They either break enemies, or should withdraw to charge again. Their steeds are fast moving and carry them to key points on the battlefield very quickly. Their morale is superb, but they are not suitably equipped for prolonged melee. A lancer is at a disadvantage in a close-in fight. Used against elite infantry in square their skills and lances will, of course, count for very little.\n\nOriginally formed as a hussar regiment, these men were transformed into lancers by a decree issued on the 23rd September 1810. Their first challenge was to learn how to handle the apparently unwieldy, but deadly lance. Several officers were sent to the Polish Lancers’ Chantilly barracks where they were drilled in the much-needed skills of the lance. These men then passed their new found wisdom to the rest of their regiment in Versailles. The reorganisation of the new Guard Lancers resulted in a number of uniform changes that proved extremely costly. The Minister of War had to ask Napoleon himself to provide them with more money to pay for new uniforms for the men!</long_description_text>

<description_text>This fast light cavalry unit is best used for dealing with skirmishers and artillery who can attack from long range.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLifeguard Hussars are members of Russia’s Imperial Guard cavalry, and all are elite servicemen. Dressed in impressive uniforms and riding the fastest of horses, they enjoy a high status in the Russian army, and are supremely sure of their abilities, sometimes to the point of arrogance. They have excellent morale and speed, making them exceptional when charging, and ideal for chasing down skirmishers or attacking artillery units. However, they sacrifice some strength for speed and are vulnerable if pitted against heavier cavalry in melee or infantry units in square.\n\nCzar Paul I (1754-1801) formed his own personal guard cavalry in the Lifeguard Hussars, Chevalier-Garde, Horse Guards and Lifeguard Cossacks when he was crowned. These new bodyguards replaced the existing guard cavalry created by his mother, Catherine the Great (1729 -1796). Disgusted by what he saw as the decadence and corruption of the old nobility, Paul I devoted his reign to renewing the medieval notion of chivalry through a reorganisation of the Russian hierarchy. Unfortunately, Paul I’s long-held fear of assassination was justified: he was soon murdered by disgruntled members of the nobility.</long_description_text>

These men are incredibly disciplined, and they are excellent marksmen with fast reloading times, though their close formations leave them vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. Being an elite unit, the regiment is expensive to recruit, but the men’s abilities more than justify the extra cost.\n\nThe Russian Lifeguards were famed for their fine appearance. They were hand-picked for looks and stature, and even had jackets padded around the chest and shoulders to enhance their impressive physiques. Lady Burghersh (wife of the Military Commissioner at the Allies’ Headquarters and a prolific letter writer) believed them to be “the handsomest of the empire… all gigantic; they are composed of the tallest men in Russia.” Even von Schubert was forced to concede that these men were “the focal point of the balls and every other kind of society.” However, their immaculate good looks did not imply equally good manners and, at a banquet held in their honour, Napoleon’s own guards were appalled to see the Russians tearing meat with their hands, draining glasses of wine in one gulp, and even vomiting to make room for more gluttony and drinking!</long_description_text>

Their overall competence and excellent morale inspire nearby troops to fight all the harder. However, in common with ordinary line regiments, the Coldsteamers are vulnerable to artillery bombardment and skirmishers’ sniping.\n\nAt the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the Coldstream Guards defended Hougoumont. The farm was important for Wellington’s Anglo-Dutch army as it protected his right flank. Despite assault after assault, the Guards and their comrades managed to hold the place against the French.\n\nThe Coldstream Guards are still in service today and continue to celebrate their victory with the ceremony of ”Hanging the Brick”. A large stone from Hougoumont is marched through their barracks by the officers while the junior ranks attempt to steal it.

<description_text>This highly-disciplined line infantry regiment excels at weapons drill and accuracy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAs part of the Archduke’s military reforms, these troops are trained in the latest military style in a bid to copy the success of Napoleon’s Grande Armée. This training improves accuracy, reloading and close combat skills. There is also a morale effect: the men are filled with a renewed confidence that makes them unlikely to rout. However, as with most line infantry, they have little defence against units such as artillery or skirmishing snipers and will be at a disadvantage against elite infantry.\n\nIn 1806, Austria was still reeling from her defeat by France at Austerlitz. Austrian conservatism and tradition had resulted in an outdated and outmatched army, and its defeat by the French forced them to accept the harsh terms of the Treaty of Pressburg. Archduke Charles, a highly respected field-marshal, recognised that the Austrian army needed modernising and introduced a number of military reforms. These improvements were tested during the Peninsular War period when the Austrians formed the Fifth Coalition against France. It was during this coalition that the Legion took part in the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon’s first defeat in over ten years.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Swift light cavalry, the riders of Luetzow’s Freikorps are excellent in melee and on the charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe men of Luetzow’s Freikorps have immense pride in their regiment and as a consequence exhibit excellent morale. These fast, light cavalry are an effective fighting force whether charging home or fighting in close quarters. Their flexibility in battle makes them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers, but will be of little utility against heavier cavalry in melee. As with any cavalry unit their biggest threat is infantry in square formation.\n\nA certain amount of romance is attached to Luetzow’s Freikorps. Following a crushing defeat on 17th July 1813, the Freikorps began recruiting in earnest; during this time a large number of intellectuals, artists and poets were drawn to Luetzow’s regiment. This was thanks in part to his reputation for personal bravery and the regiment’s reputation for derring-do. This reputation that was upheld by one of the Corps most famous members, Eleonore Prochaska: she disguised herself as a man and fought alongside her fellow soldiers until she finally met her end at the Battle of Goehrde. It was only as Prochaska lay wounded, still beating time on a stolen French drum, that she admitted her deception to her lieutenant. She was removed from the field and lived for three weeks before succumbing to her wounds.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Sabre-armed light cavalry, the Life Hussars are powerful on the charge and effective in melee combat.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards their enemies and friends. The Life Hussars are, without exception, superb horsemen, and all have a certain independence of spirit that makes them ideal for chasing down widely scattered enemies and scouting duties. They carry curved sabres and, even though their charge is a fairly powerful attack, they are relatively weak when pitted against infantry in square and against heavy cavalry units.\n\nOne of Prussia’s most famous generals, Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, began his military career as a hussar. Swedish by birth, he joined the Swedish army at the age of 16 but transferred his allegiance to Prussia after he was captured in 1760. However, a slight tendency towards excess meant he was often passed over for promotion, leading him to resign his commission in 1773. Upon receiving this resignation Frederick the Great was reported to say “Captain Blücher can take himself to the devil.” He was blacklisted, and Blücher was unable to rejoin the army until after the death of Frederick. Once back, he distinguished himself, going on to play one of the key roles in the Allied victory at Waterloo.</long_description_text>

<key>British_95th_Rifles</key>
<description_text>Armed with very accurate rifles, these marksmen are an elite skirmishing force.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe flintlock rifles these men carry have an astonishing range and accuracy. Their skirmishing abilities allow them to use whatever cover is available to hide, stalk enemies, and then kill them at great distances. In an age of military peacocks, their uniforms are a dark, subdued colour to help them in their role as hunters. They are, however, not invulnerable. Like all skirmishers, they can be cut down by a carefully organised cavalry attack. They will also suffer if exposed to volleys from a line unit.\n\nThe 95th Rifles started in 1800 as the Experimental Corps of Riflemen in Horsham, Sussex (co-incidentally, the developers of this game are based in the same town). Unlike the rest of the British army, who sported the famous red coat, riflemen wore a distinctive dark green jacket, the first British attempt at camouflage. A good rifleman was expected to think for himself; if he could not read, he was taught, in order to give him a fair chance at promotion. The class distinctions between officers and men still existed in “the Rifles” but trust and respect were emphasised: officers, for example, regularly dined with their men. Officers were also expected to become marksmen at least as expert as their soldiers.</long_description_text>

<key>Guerrilla_Leader</key>
<description_text>This leader inspires nearby troops with his presence, giving them fresh hope and heart even when all seems lost. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGuerrilla Leaders are men of the people, driven to take up arms out by patriotism or a need for vengeance. Natural leaders and tacticians, they have proved their suitability for command by surviving and winning. They may be drawn from the minor gentry, the aristocracy, or even the common people, but are all equally capable of killing Frenchmen. They can also inspire loyalty in their countrymen. They are accompanied by a bodyguard of carbine-armed fighters, but are more effective when inspiring the men rather than risking their own lives.\n\nOne of the most famous, and successful, Spanish Guerrilla Leaders was Francisco Espoz y Mina, or “Mina the Elder” (1781-1836). Like many of the guerrillas he came from humble beginnings, but after seeing the behaviour of the French became determined to pay back their cruelty a thousand-fold. His determination made him feared by the French and a hero in the eyes of the Spanish, who nicknamed him “King of Navarre”. His success was, however, built on ruthlessness: in one case, he blinded and mutilated French prisoners before executing them, as a lesson to their general.</long_description_text>

<key>Guerrilla_Lanceros</key>
<description_text>Guerrilla Lanceros are swift, irregular horsemen who use their lances in devastating charges. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe sight and sound of thundering cavalry, lances thrust forward, is a fearsome thing to behold. Guerrilla Lanceros are supposed to use their horsemanship to punch a hole through enemy defences, causing casualties and possibly breaking the enemy in the process. After a charge, they should withdraw quickly and reform, as lances are too unwieldy to use in close combat. Staying for a prolonged fight might prove too dangerous for the lancers!\n\nNapoleon’s occupation of Spain and depredations by French soldiers outraged the Spanish, leading many of them to seek revenge. Julian Sanchez was an ex-soldier and farmer who raised a band of Guerrilla Lancers after the French brutalised his family. Sanchez grasped that light cavalrymen with an intimate knowledge of the country could carry out small, but damaging, attacks. His lancers would lay in wait for days and then ambush small convoys, gathering intelligence as they did so. In the process, French morale was damaged and the lives of the French were made as miserable and dangerous as possible. He quickly gained the attention of the Duke of Wellington as well as the Spanish people, who showed their respect by addressing him as “Don Julian”.</long_description_text>

<key>Guerrilla_Husares</key>
<description_text>These mounted troops are versatile and fast moving, particularly effective against enemies such as skirmishers and artillery. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe essence of the guerrilla or “little war” is that a small force can take on a much larger foe by relying on ambushes, cunning and speed. Guerrilla Húsares are motivated by their hatred for the French, which drives them forward during their impressive cavalry charges. Their speed and agility should be used to chase down skirmishers or disrupt enemy artillery, but they will be outclassed should they ever face heavier cavalry in melee or, for that matter, infantry in square.\n\nThe mountainous terrain of Spain and Portugal made movement by heavy cavalry or artillery slow and difficult for all the armies in the Peninsular War. The roads that did exist were rough and poorly maintained, prompting the Grand Armée and the Spanish guerrillas to rely on lighter cavalry such as hussars as the mobile elements. Many of the guerrillas were actually from the towns and villages found high in the mountains. Their local knowledge gave them an advantage in covering ground. Their reputation as mountain “savages” was as useful as numbers in intimidating the French; it was a notoriety enhanced by the collecting French ears and fingers as war trophies.</long_description_text>

<key>Guerrilla_Cazadores</key>
<description_text>This light infantry force form a screen to slow the enemy advance and keep their own battle line unmolested by enemy skirmishers. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIt is the job of these men to cover the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important enemy leaders. Their range and accuracy are excellent but their inability to form square leaves them vulnerable to cavalry, and a well trained infantry unit will best them in line. However, Guerrilla Cazadores are capable of forming a disciplined line as well as fighting in loose skirmish order.\n\nAlthough the romantic image of the guerrilla is of a wild man of the mountains, hiding amongst rocks and sleeping under the stars, some were simply professionals who took up arms to protect their fellow countrymen. Juan Palarea Blanes or El Medico, &quot;The Doctor”, had a successful medical practice in Madrid, at least until the French occupation in 1808. His treatment at French hands forced him to raise a band of guerrillas, originally mainly mounted troops that thwarted the French at every opportunity. In May of 1811 he added the Cazadores Francos Numantinos to his party. These light troops were soon incorporated into the 4th Spanish Army and El Medico and his men gained a reputation for bravery as they fought for the people of Spain.</long_description_text>

<description_text>As sharpshooters the Guerrilla Tiradores are perfect for harassing an enemy from afar. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLargely recruited from among hunters and farmers living in the Spanish mountains, these men have grown up using firearms, and they are crack shots. Their hunting and tracking experience allows them to hide and their loose formation helps to protect them from bombardment. These sharpshooters are best employed sniping enemies from a distance: they will take heavy losses in close-combat, have precious little defence against cavalry, and will they suffer in a formal exchange of volleys with against other infantry.\n\nGuerrilla bands were created by the Spanish to fight back against occupying French forces during the Peninsular War. Often outnumbered and outgunned, the guerrillas relied heavily on skirmishing, ambushing and superior knowledge of the landscape to obtain a tactical advantage. Francisco Espoz y Mina (1781-1836) made himself into an expert on guerrilla tactics. He started his career in the “Tiradores de Doyle”, a guerrilla band put together by British officer, Col. Charles W. Doyle, and then went on to be one of the most feared fighting men in Spain.</long_description_text>

<key>Guerrilla_Fusiliers</key>
<description_text>Guerrilla Fusiliers are a versatile infantry unit able to form line to use their muskets and bayonets to full effect. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRecruited from vengeful and patriotic Spaniards outraged by the French usurpation of their lands, Guerrilla Fusiliers are mountain men who have grown up using firearms, swords and knives. This personal experience makes them individually skilled and they are effective in melee as a result. They are at a disadvantage when facing enemies such artillery and skirmishers, but they have enough tactical sense to be able to form square when threatened by cavalry.\n\nDuring the French occupation of Spain, the French army committed many crimes against the Spanish people, often with the connivance of their officers. Theft, rape and murder were commonplace, and seen as practical ways to strike back at the “brigands” and “bandits” of the guerrilla, or little war. Friends and family would suffer, even if the fighters did not. In their turn, the Spanish treated any Frenchmen they caught with similar brutality. Family honour, a driving force for many Spaniards, meant that they had to avenge their dead no matter what the personal cost. So while the government apparently did little, the people made the lives of the French invaders a hell of ambushes and fear. The French army was almost paralysed at times by the need to protect its rear and supply lines from the guerrillas.</long_description_text>

<key>French_Contra_Guerrillas</key>
<description_text>Crack-shots with exceptional defence abilities, contra-guerrillas are perfect for harassing the enemy from afar. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men have been trained as guerrillas, but for reasons of their own have taken up arms against their Spanish brothers for Bonaparte. Their hunting and tracking experience helps them to hide in all kinds of terrain, and set ambushes. They fight in a loose formation and crouch to protect themselves from enemy fire. These sharpshooters are best employed in sniping at enemies, as they will suffer heavy losses in close combat and have little chance against cavalry. They will also suffer when matched against volley-firing line infantry.\n\nAfter the occupation of Spain in 1808, Napoleon’s forces faced considerable hostility from Spanish guerrilla bands. Local rebellions had been expected, but the sheer ferocity of the guerrillas shook the French army and morale suffered as a result. The French needed their own guerrillas and set about recruiting fugitives and deserters, as “Contra-Guerrillas”. Only those with nothing left to lose would risk facing the loyalist guerrillas, as they would face a grisly death if captured.</long_description_text>

<key>Spanish_Coraceros_Espanoles</key>
<description_text>Coraceros Españoles are powerful heavy cavalry, who wear cuirasses for protection and for extra weight in their devastating charge.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe flash of the Coraceros Españoles’ swords, and the gleam of their breastplates, may very well be the last thing an enemy ever sees, such is the finality of their charge! They are relatively slow moving because they are heavyweights, but when it comes to punching holes in an enemy’s defences, they are almost unmatched. Once their charge is over they can stay and fight in melee. They are exceptional warriors, and need only show due caution when facing guard cavalry or elite infantry.\n\nThe Coraceros Españoles claimed their uniforms, armour and weapons from captured French cuirassiers after the Battle of Mollet in 1810. A lack of funds, along with losses of men and horses during the war, often meant that the Spanish army was short of supplies, despite receiving considerable support from the British. This was particularly true for cavalry units, where some cavalrymen had to actually serve on foot due to a lack of suitable horses!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Reliable, sturdy and fast, line cavalry are a good all-round mounted unit. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nArmed with a traditional straight sword, as opposed to the ever-popular sabre, these cavalrymen are a multipurpose unit. They are light enough to chase down a routing enemy, but heavy enough to charge effectively into enemy lines. However, their versatility comes at the cost of specialisation: should they be pitted against the likes of horse guards, their lack of specialist training will become apparent. \n\nSpain and the Peninsular War proved to be a major part in the downfall of Napoleon and this was thanks, in part, to his older brother Joseph. Joseph helped his brother to take control of France during the revolution and was rewarded with the throne of Naples in 1806. His time as king was brief, and he was soon sent elsewhere when Spain fell under Napoleon’s control. Napoleon needed someone he could trust on the Spanish throne and Joseph was the obvious choice. However, French occupation of Spain was unpopular to say the least and Joseph never really managed to gain a steady grip on the country. French control was eventually broken at the Battle of Vitoria and Joseph abdicated, fleeing back to France.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These mounted light infantry help to slow the enemy advance and keep their own line untroubled by enemy skirmishers. Guerrilla units can be deployed anywhere on the battlefield except inside the enemy deployment zone or within range of the enemy general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy ranks. Unlike their comrades in the line and light infantry, they are mounted and can fight on foot if needed. They form up in a loose skirmish line, firing independently at their self-designated targets. The result is a constant barrage rather than a devastating volley, but a deadly one as officers and sergeants are removed from the fight.\n\nHistorically, Cazadores were trained to defend the border between Spain and Portugal, an area of much activity before and during the Peninsular War. In 1800, Napoleon and his Spanish ally, Manuel de Gordoy, demanded that Portugal ally with France. This was something that Portugal, a long-standing ally of the British, refused to do. In 1801 French and Spanish troops under Gordoy took the Portuguese town of Olivenza. Once the fighting was over, Gordoy picked oranges from a nearby grove and sent them back to the Queen to inform her of his victory, giving the affair the title of “The War of the Oranges”.</long_description_text>

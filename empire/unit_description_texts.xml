<description_text>Howitzers send shells plunging into enemy formations and over defences, making cover irrelevant.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHowitzers fall somewhere between guns and mortars, the other main artillery types. They have a limited mobility, like guns. Like mortars, they do not fire straight at the target, but send shots high into the air to plunge down on a target (and over anything in the way). By angling the barrel and changing the propellant charge used, howitzers have an impressive flexibility in shell trajectories. Experienced crews can lob explosive shells and incendiary rounds with great accuracy into a “beaten zone”, making life utterly miserable and very short for anyone within it. In close action, they can fire canister rounds directly into enemy formations, like giant sawn-off shotguns.\n\nThe term foot artillery applies because the gunners walk into battle alongside the draft animals. Like all artillery, the rating of these howitzers refers to the nominal weight of shot fired; loading the heavier pieces made for strong gunners!\n\nHistorically, howitzers – like many other artillery pieces – were far from standardised weapons in the 18th Century. Shells and spare parts made in one foundry did not always fit another foundry’s pieces, even if the calibre was nominally identical and the two guns were part of the same battery in the field. It took a good deal of effort and argument to get foundries to standardise barrels and ancillary equipment, even in a single country.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Foot artillery batteries are the core of an army on campaign: the weapons that win battles and batter down walls.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDespite the name, foot artillery batteries are towed by horses, not men. The artillerymen march alongside their pieces. All guns are smoothbore, and rated by the size or weight of solid projectile that they fire: a 12-pounder is so called because it hurls a cannonball weighing 12 pounds towards the enemy! It may not do so very accurately, as the casting of barrels and balls means that there is inevitably a gap (windage) between a shot and the barrel sides. This means that a cannonball rattles down the barrel when fired, leading to an inherent inaccuracy.  As technology advances, other types of ammunition can be fired.\n\nHistorically, there was limited standardisation between guns, even in the same battery. Parts from one gun would not always fit a sister piece. A gunner would know the quirks of his own weapon intimately. Cunningly, the French attempted to develop a system of interchangeable components for all their guns and field equipment. Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval (1715-1789), the inspector of artillery, tried but he wasn’t entirely successful. Even after he had finished there were still more than 20 different types of wheel in use!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Intended to keep up with rapidly-advancing mounted forces, horse artillery batteries have a touch of “cavalry dash” about them.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHorse artillery units are distinguished from other types of artillery forces because everyone rides into battle: drivers ride the horses, while gun crews are often given seats on the gun limbers. The cannons assigned to horse artillery units usually fire relatively small calibre rounds although, as always, the weight of shot is used to designate different horse artillery types. The weight of fire is considered to be less important than the speed with which it can be moved to a firing position, deployed, and then removed to a new site. This is what gives horse artillery its appeal to generals: the ability to rapidly give fire from almost anywhere on the battlefield. Horse artillery can be used as a flexible reserve, or to exploit a weakness in an enemy line.\n\nHistorically, in many countries horse artillery developed a cavalry-like air of being an elite force. This attitude is entirely understandable. Dragging heavy artillery pieces across country at the gallop is an inherently dangerous thing to do, even without people shooting at you!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Garrison artillery units are intended to serve in fortresses; they do not need to be mobile, just efficient in blowing attackers off the fort’s approaches! </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCannon in garrison service are often mounted on very different carriages from field pieces, often resembling the trucks used aboard ship; cast iron carriages are also used. Garrison guns simply never have to be dragged across country, so the only purpose of the carriage is to help absorb recoil. The lack of mobility also means that large guns can be used and served with ammunition: again, it only has to come from a central magazine, not be carried across open country.\n\nLife in a garrison was often seen as an easier option than going on campaign for artillerymen, and it was in comparison to living in camp in all weathers. However, garrison troops never had the chance to make an informal profit from their military service by looting, and promotions could be agonisingly slow. For the really unlucky, garrison life could be a death sentence too. Some parts of the world that needed defending were notoriously unhealthy. Being sent to defend some Caribbean islands was, in effect, an invitation to your own funeral!</long_description_text>

<description_text>The first rate is the largest type of “ship of the line of battle”, intended to be the centre of any fleet. These are very expensive and powerful vessels.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhile these warships are among the most powerful vessels afloat, they are poor sailors, being both slow and unresponsive. This is not a serious shortcoming because, armed with around 100 cannons firing 32-, 24- and 18-pounder balls on their three decks, they can fire a terrible and destructive broadside. They carry a crew of over 800 sailors, gunners and marines and have more artillery than most land armies. Their cost, however, is a drawback and few navies can afford to build or maintain more than a handful of them.\n\nHistorically, first rates were never common, and hardly ever sent to overseas stations. They existed purely to fight in set-piece battles, and were not used for mundane duties such as protecting merchantmen, policing the seas and hunting down privateers.</long_description_text>

The British Royal Navy’s HMS St Lawrence was built, launched and served only on Lake Ontario. Shallow rapids meant that few vessels could reach the lake from the sea, and Niagara Falls prevented any ship from leaving the lake in the other direction.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A demi-cannon is a heavy artillery piece from the previous century, deployed in a fixed battlefield position.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough obsolete, a demi-cannon is still a dangerous weapon to face as it fires a ball with a nominal weight of around 24 pounds. This large calibre makes for a large weapon with a massive gun carriage. Once properly emplaced, a demi-cannon is hard enough to adjust for aim, let alone drag to a new location! Originally, this lack of tactical mobility was not a problem, as the gun was for siege work or for a battlefield where there was little artillery present. It was unlikely to ever suffer any kind of counter-battery fire, so didn’t need to be moved.\n\nArtillery was sometimes incredibly dangerous to its users as well as the targets: fire was a terrible risk. The artillery baggage train usually held an enormous quantity of powder, and any stray spark was liable to cause an explosion. Anyone out of place caught near the powder train could expect little mercy: some generals ordered that enemy agents should be burned alive if caught in an arson attempt, and immediate lynching for their own errant soldiers wandering too near the artillery train!</long_description_text>

<description_text>The second rate is a three-deck “Battle Ship of the Line” carrying up to 98 cannons, a powerful unit in any fleet.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis three-deck warship is a compromise design between the firepower of a first rate ship and the sea-keeping qualities of a third-rate 74. Like many compromises, the result is something that pleases few, but the extra weight of the broadside does compensate for poor sailing qualities. The design does have one unexpected benefit: enemy captains are often quick to identify second rates as much larger ships and, as a result, flee from a “much superior” enemy! \n\nThe lower gun deck houses 32-pounders, and this explains the “tumblehome” shape of all ships of the period: the bulge at water level and just above in the hull allowed more room on the lower decks for the recoil of large cannons; the lighter guns on the higher decks did not recoil as much.\n\nHistorically, only the British Royal Navy commissioned many ships of this rating; other nations simply built first rates instead. This might be due to the Royal Navy needing to keep large ships on foreign stations as flagships, an assignment that would have been wasteful and expensive for a first rate.</long_description_text>

<key>3rd_rate</key>
<description_text>The third rate is an excellent compromise between firepower and handling qualities. A stable gun platform, it has more guns than many whole armies!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe third rate, or “74” (from the number of guns aboard), is a supremely practical weapon of war. With a crew of around 700 men, it is a “wooden world” in itself and a statement of national power. A two-deck design, it is strong enough to mount very heavy cannons on its lower gun deck, often 32-pounders. With 18-pounders on the upper gun deck and then 9-pounders in the upper works, it has a devastating broadside. The design and construction means a 74 can withstand horrendous damage in battle.\n\nHistorically, the French invented the concept of the 74-gun ship in the mid-18th century. The design was so good that other navies lost no time in copying it or in capturing French ships. French vessels, while well designed, were often made from green timber that “worked” in heavy seas and therefore leaked. Dutch examples had a shallower, broader draft to suit their harbours and shore waters. The few American 74s were extremely strong and well made. British 74s were well constructed too, although there was a regrettable tendency to save money by recycling timbers - complete with timber rot - from older vessels!\n\nAmazingly, HMS Implacable, the last of the third rates, was scuttled in 1949! Built in 1800 by the French, and captured at Trafalgar in 1805, she stayed in service until 1842. Eventually, she ended her days as a coal hulk.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The third rate is a compromise between firepower and handling. A stable gun platform, it also makes a good flagship.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOverall, the “74” (from the number of guns carried) or “third rate” is a very practical vessel. With a crew of around 700 men, it has enough firepower and resilience to survive most battles. It can deliver a horrendously effective broadside from its 32-pounders (on the lower deck), 18-pounders on the upper deck and 9-pounders in the upper works. It also has enough space to house an admiral and his busy staff in some comfort, even if the ship’s officers have to sacrifice their living space.\n\nHistorically, many admirals and commodores chose 74s to be their flag vessels. In the 18th Century “commodore” was not a formalised naval rank, but an appointment as a “temporary fleet commander”. Appointing a commodore allowed the navy to choose any talented or well-connected captain, no matter how junior, for command. Admiral was usually a rank that any captain, no matter how useless, could reach if he lived for long enough!</long_description_text>

<key>4_inch_mortar</key>
<description_text>A mortar is a large calibre, fixed artillery piece that lobs an explosive shell in a high arc at the enemy. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTo the uneducated eye, a mortar looks like a large, stumpy cooking pot, set at an angle in a heavy wooden frame. Indeed, the weapon’s name may even have come from its similarity to the mortars used to grind spices. Mortars use indirect fire, firing their shells high into the air to plunge down on enemy positions. This makes them ideal for use in siege warfare.\n\nUnlike a howitzer, a mortar uses a fixed, and relatively small, charge of gunpowder to propel its shell. Range is adjusted by changing the angle of fire; accuracy is subject to winds and weather, thanks to the flight path. There is also a practical minimum range to mortar fire: no artilleryman is going to drop a shell so close that he will be caught in the blast. Their size, expressed in terms of the diameter of shell they fire, indicates their destructiveness.\n\nMortars have returned to favour with armies since the First World War. Modern designs, based on the British Stokes trench mortar, come in many sizes. Most can fire shells with proximity fuses as anti-personnel rounds. The larger examples can fire sophisticated “smart” munitions that guide themselves onto targets.</long_description_text>

<key>4th_rate</key>
<description_text>The fourth rate is the smallest vessel styled a “ship of the line” (of battle), carrying as many as 60 guns. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nShips of the line of battle are the mainstay of fighting fleets: strong and stable gun platforms for battering enemy vessels into submission. The designation of “fourth rate” for ships of this size is a British Royal Navy one, and covers a number of designs, all with very similar handling and combat power. All fourth rates are square-rigged, two-deck ships, with up to 60 guns on board in a mixture of calibres: usually a mixture of 24-, 18- and 12-pounders, with the heavier guns mounted on the lower deck.\n\nEven though fourth rates are obviously smaller than the third-rate 74s, their firepower is much lower than a simple number-of-guns comparison would indicate. There is no structural strength or space for coping with the recoil of massive guns. As a result, a fourth rate may only have half the weight of fire of a larger ship, although partially it makes up for this by being a handier sailing vessel, especially in shallow waters.\n\nHistorically, it was obvious by the 1750s that ships of this size were not tough enough to stand in the line of battle against larger vessels. Over time, various admiralties removed these smaller battle ships from the active service, or sent them to minor stations where they were unlikely to encounter powerful enemies. Some survived as converted transports.</long_description_text>

<key>4th_rate_frigate_standard</key>
<description_text>Many consider these large and powerful frigates the equal of a fourth rate “ship of the line” in terms of fighting power. Swift, deadly and strongly built, these are handy vessels.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA frigate is a single-deck, square-rigged warship, generally used as a scouting vessel for the main battle fleet or as a “cruiser”, sent out to operate independently and cause trouble to enemies in far off waters. Frigates have the speed to chase down merchantmen, and the fighting power to overwhelm them easily.\n\nAlthough strictly a contradiction in terms, the “fourth rate frigate” is a powerful vessel, easily having the firepower of a “fourth rate” ship of the line, allied to the sailing characteristics and speed of a frigate. Early examples of these 44-gun single deck ships carried 24-pounder cannons on the lower deck; later examples were constructed that carried 32-pounders! With the development of carronades (short-barrelled, short-ranged cannons that were never counted in the official gun rating), this gave them a weight of shot that equalled or exceeded that of many smaller ships of the line. \n\nHistorically, the United States Navy, in particular, had a habit of building strong and oversize ships, possibly because they plentiful timber in America’s virgin forests, and because the weather in the Atlantic required strong ships. As with all frigates, these ships were plum appointments for ambitious or greedy captains – independence of action and the chance of prize money were a heady combination!</long_description_text>

<key>5th_rate</key>
<description_text>Frigates are single-deck warships, used for a variety of tasks thanks to a combination of good handling, firepower and endurance at sea. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\n“Fifth rate” is a Royal Navy term for the largest of the single-deck frigates, square-rigged ships that carry some 44 guns, usually no heavier than 12-pounders. Originally a French design – but quickly adopted by the other European powers – the frigate is used for pursuit, convoy protection, commerce raiding and reconnaissance work. The design’s excellent sailing characteristics and good handling, especially in inshore waters, make it a useful addition to any blockading fleet. The frigate’s ability to operate far away from a home port also makes it a useful cruiser, carrying the fight to the enemy in unexpected waters. \n\nFrigates can have the advantage over larger, two-deck ships in rough waters. A frigate captain rarely has to worry about his gun deck taking on water, and can therefore fight in conditions that leave bigger ships at a disadvantage. However, fifth rates are not powerful enough to face battleships. They have the speed and handling to stay out of trouble; they do not have the strength of construction to survive a pounding! Against sloops, brigs and merchantmen, however, they are deadly. This makes them excellent postings for officers hungry for prize money and glory. \n\nFrigates captains made splendid role models for fictional heroes: Thomas, Lord Cochrane earned a fortune in prize money, gained the nickname “le loup des mers” (sea-wolf) and was the inspiration for fictional heroes Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Flagship frigates are single-deck warships, combining good handling, firepower and endurance at sea.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese handy frigates are used for pursuit, convoy protection, commerce raiding and reconnaissance work and, when operating as a detached squadron, as a flagship for the admiral in charge. Excellent sailing characteristics, especially in inshore waters, make it a useful addition to any blockading fleet, and perfect for aggressive admirals. Accommodations for the flag officer and his small staff may be a little on the snug side, as these are fighting vessels with little spare room for many creature comforts. This is a footling inconvenience when considered against the chance to carry the fight to the foe! An admiral’s flagship, normally a somewhat staid appointment, is an excellent appointment for men who are hungry for glory – when that flagship is a frigate.\n\nHistorically, the term “fifth rate” is a Royal Navy one, and applies to the largest single-deck frigates, mounting some 44 12-pounder guns. However, every navy that used European designs found a use for this class of vessel.</long_description_text>

<key>64_lber_fort_carronade</key>
<description_text>Carronades are “sawn off” cannons that fire a very heavy ball but only over a short range. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOriginally developed for naval warfare where their light weight and awesome firepower made them ideal aboard ship, carronades are also very useful for the close-in defence of fortifications. Their limited range is not an issue, as an enemy has to come within range when an assault is mounted; the exact opposite would be the case in a field battle, where the battery could easily be outflanked by staying out of range.\n\nHistorically, the Carron Company of Scotland developed the weapon to supplement the long guns carried on Royal Navy ships. Despite the weight of shot fired, the powder charge was not large. This meant that the barrel did not need to be heavy (it did not have to resist high pressures) or long. This lower charge also reduced recoil and, unfortunately, weapon range: there is always a trade-off to be made somewhere. That said, carronades could do horrendous damage: a 64-pounder would fire a solid shot of that weight and a canister of 500 musket balls could be packed into the barrel as well! No attacking force would relish facing that kind of danger.</long_description_text>

The impact of such a shot crushes anyone unlucky enough to be caught, and does terrible damage to any structure hit. That canister shot can be added on top of such a ball is merely piling on the misery for the unfortunate targets. These enormous guns require large-scale support to operate effectively. Indeed, in Indian service they are often towed by elephants rather than a team of smaller draught oxen!\n\nHistorically, guns this size were difficult to cast without flaws; the size of gunpowder charge involved in firing these guns meant that any flaw would be fatal to the gunners. Secondly, there was the difficulty of moving these guns to the battlefield. Smaller artillery produced substantial trains of draught animals, additional carts for powder, spares and shot, (all with more draught animals) – and then all of these would need feeding and watering, even before the gun crews were considered. That it was considered worthwhile to produce and then use these guns with all these drawbacks shows just how destructive they were.</long_description_text>

<key>6th_rate</key>
<description_text>A sixth rate is the smallest class of frigate. It is a useful scout for slow battle fleets, and usually has excellent handling characteristics.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Royal Navy system of rating ships defines a “sixth rate” as a small frigate: a single-deck ship, square-rigged, with around 28 nine-pounder guns, and a crew of around 200 men. This is the smallest vessel in the system set out by Samuel Pepys (the very same fellow who is now famous for his sometimes rude diaries), and the smallest command of a post captain. This means that sixth rate captains are either old men, passed over for command, or young, ambitious officers looking to make their mark. It’s also worth pointing out that, even with “only” 28 nine-pounder cannons at his command, the captain of a sloop has more firepower than many generals ashore!\n\nHistorically, the sixth rates’ small size made them handy for scouting work and perfect where speed and good sailing qualities were required. They were a very good counter to privateers in smaller luggers, brigs and sloops; sixth rates can chase them down and have enough guns and men to win the subsequent engagement! They were also extremely useful in blockades, as they could sail in shallow waters and keep close watch on enemy ports.</long_description_text>

<key>9_lber_land_cannon_(saker)</key>
<description_text>A saker is an old-fashioned style of light cannon, deployed in a fixed position.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nArtillery pieces are expensive to cast; as a result, they tend to be in service until captured, destroyed or rusted away. Sakers are a prime example of this, as many of the barrels date back to the 17th Century, even if they have been taken from dust-covered warehouses and mounted on refurbished carriages.\n\nThey are relatively light cannons in terms of the shot fired, which is much the same as a six-pounder. Some sakers are even old enough to have been intended for stone ammunition, and this is reflected in the fact that the windage (or difference between the barrel bore and shot size) is often quite large. This “rattling” of a shot down the barrel when it is fired does not help accuracy.\n\nDespite the light weight of shot, sakers are anything but lightweight guns. Saker gun carriages are large, awkward and tactically immobile. Gunners and draft animals can drag them into place before a battle, but there is little chance of moving a gun to a better firing position once the action has commenced.\n\nAlthough obsolescent, there were 14 sakers in the “Blenheim train” of artillery in 1704 available to the Duke of Marlborough – guns were expensive and he took what was available.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These African warriors are fierce fighters, but not as disciplined as European troops. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are also largely unschooled in modern tactics and fight as heroic individuals rather than an organised military force. They have little to lose and much to gain by “taking up the sword”: freedom from the threat of slavery, for a start. Because of this heroic style of fighting, the loss of only a few prominent individuals can throw the whole unit into disarray.\n\nHistorically, freed slaves were used as militias and defensive forces in the New World from time to time. Plantation owners in the Caribbean were understandably reluctant to arm any Africans for fear of revenge being taken. Servile insurrections were a terrible threat, given the appalling conditions that were visited upon the slave population. During the American War of Independence the British offered freedom to any Africans who came over to their side, but these promises proved to be of little worth when the war ended. The freedmen were dumped in singularly harsh and unattractive corners of the remaining British possessions, and left to shift for themselves without much further support.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A frigate is a single deck warship, used for independent cruises, commerce raiding and convoy protection.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAmerican frigates are stronger than those built by other nations, both in terms of the punishment they can sustain and in weight of broadside. The two factors are related: the design includes diagonal bracing, and thick planking, allowing a ship of this type to mount 24-pounder cannons in place of the usual 12-pounders carried aboard frigates. This American frigate still has all the traditional virtues of the type. It is a good sailor, and can operate far from home waters. It outguns other frigates, but has the necessary speed to escape from larger battleships.\nHistorically, the reasons for creating a class of large frigates were strategically sound for the fledgling United States. There was, of course, no shortage of suitable timber in American yards on the eastern seaboard to make ships to this design. More importantly, however, the design recognised that America simply didn’t have the manpower to create a navy to the European model. She needed ships that used relatively small crews for the amount of havoc they could cause!</long_description_text>

<description_text>The woods of the frontier have taught these men the value of marksmanship and an accurate firearm.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe fur trade which thrives in the American frontier forests is a rich source of men who are reliant on their marksmanship for survival. With no ready access to the kind of manufactories found in Europe, this hardy and self-sufficient breed have learnt to fashion their own rifles. The guns themselves reflect the demands made by their environment. With an unusually long rifled barrel, they are far more accurate than any smooth-bore musket, an important factor when powder and shot are hard to come by and game must be stalked for many hours before a shot can be taken. This distinctive design is however slightly awkward to reload.\n\nThe skills of the hunter translate well to the battlefield, especially when employed against regular troops who often have no experience of such tactics and no answer to a foe who appears as if from nowhere and will not then stand still to be shot at. Adept at concealing themselves amongst trees, these men can stalk any prey, remaining hidden as they slowly move within range.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThe Mescalero Apache are a mountain people and, unusually for such a folk, highly skilled riders. Masters of irregular warfare, they have an intimate knowledge of the landscape, and concealment skills that give them an edge over enemies. The Mescalero Apache take full advantage of the environment, and recognise the importance of subterfuge and diversions when fighting a larger enemy force.\n\nThey even create fake camps, climb sheer rock faces to leave no trail, and live off the land, all to confound enemy trackers. Their horses are not only for hunting and battle, but are also eaten when food is scarce.\n\nThe Mescalero Apache lived among the mountains of New Mexico and Texas. The heart of their homeland was the peak of the Sierra Blanca. Their name originates from their use of the century mescal plant, a reliable source of food that can be found in the deserts of New Mexico. The tribe harvested the plant’s heart and cooked it by steaming. Today the plant is used in a very different form: it is distilled to create mescal, a spirit closely related to tequila.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These men are stealthy warriors armed with axes, ideal for ambushes and skirmish warfare.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAtakapa Warriors have a fearsome reputation and an ability to read a landscape intimately. This allows them to move swiftly and silently without the possibility of detection. The combination of field craft and an element of surprise make these warriors ideal for ambush and sudden skirmishes. The Atakapas’ weapons of choice are tomahawks, small axes that lend themselves perfectly to quiet attacks, either when thrown or in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nThe Atakapa originated from present day Louisiana and had a reputation among their neighbours for cannibalism. Literally translated, the name Atakapa means ‘man-eaters’, and was given to them by the Chocktaws. The Atakapa actually referred to themselves as the Ishaks or ‘people’. There is, of course, always the chance that the name Atakapa might have been a misunderstanding between the Chocktaws and the French explorers who first recorded the name. Cannibalism was extremely rare amongst Native American tribes, and the few recorded descriptions concern the ritualised eating of vanquished foes.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nSuch men have little to do with standard military protocols and practice, or even organisation, often taking up arms in extraordinary circumstances. This lack of discipline means that they can sometimes be extremely brutal, even brutish, in their behaviour. This can work in their favour, in that it gives enemies pause for thought. More typically, their lack of discipline counts against them, and faced with a well-ordered force they can be at a disadvantage. In such a case, their mobility can be a boon, allowing them to harass an enemy and withdraw as soon as the fight goes against them.</long_description_text>

<key>barbary_xebec</key>
<description_text>The xebec is a lateen-rigged sailing ship with exceptional speed, making it popular with North African corsairs for hunting wealthy infidel merchants!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese relatively small vessels have three masts carrying fore-and-aft lateen sails, making them handy sailors and speedy, even in light winds. The lateen sails also allow the ship to sail close-hauled to the wind, making pursuits easier. Even when becalmed, some xebecs can still be dangerous enemies to face, as they carry oars and can close with an enemy at a time of their own choosing.\n\nAlthough not quite as well armed as a European frigate, xebecs carry a formidable arsenal of 12- or 18-pounder guns. This, combined with their excellent sailing characteristics, makes them particularly suitable for piracy, and the corsairs – the infamous Barbary Pirates – of the North African coast use them. They can also carry a good-sized crew of ruffians! \n\nHistorically, the Barbary Pirates were a severe threat to European traders for centuries, partly because of excellent warships like the xebec (the name probably comes from an Arabic word “shabbak”, meaning a small warship). Eventually a few xebec-frigates were used by European Mediterranean naval powers, where the basic xebec hull shape was preserved but the distinctive lateen sails were replaced by square rigged sails. A few xebecs carried a hybrid rig with both square and lateen sails.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nBlackfoot Blood Warriors charge headlong into enemy lines bellowing fearsome war cries to terrify their enemies. They are experts at hand-to-hand fighting, and little use for anything else. Even the clothes they wear are designed to frighten and intimidate: Blood Warriors wear traditional war shirts emblazoned with symbolic representations depicting their victories in battle. These give the wearer the protection of the Spirits. They also provide an illustrated guide to all the reasons why an enemy should know fear!\n\nWarrior societies played a key role in the day to day life of young Native Americans. The Blackfoot Blood Warrior society, or “aiinikiks” (meaning “all comrades”), was a “graded” society. When a group of boys reached fighting age they would present the most junior members of the society with gifts in order to “purchase” positions. Once a deal had been struck between two fighters they would smoke a pipe to seal the deal. The warrior that had sold his position would then present gifts to a man in the grade above him, and move up in status.</long_description_text>

<key>bomb_ketch</key>
<description_text>The “bomb” is a floating weapons platform, usually adapted from a small, two-masted ketch. The whole ship is constructed around a single large-calibre mortar. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nStrongly-built bomb ketches must withstand the recoil of repeated mortar discharges. Often chains replace the rigging ropes nearest the mortar to prevent muzzle blast damage. They are the only naval vessels to carry and use explosive shells, making them a hazardous assignment. As a mark of all their explosive qualities, they often had volcanic names! The fact that the ketch should be at anchor in order to fire accurately also makes them easy targets for any return fire. \n\nBomb ketches are not good sailing ships. The mortar has to be on the centre line, with a clear vertical field of fire. This means that the masts had to be aft of their ideal positions, making the ship handling qualities rather poor. With these limitations in mind, however, they are a powerful addition to any admiral’s firepower. The ability to deliver shells by indirect fire (lobbing shells into fortifications, for example) is very useful. \n\nHistorically, the bomb ketch was a French invention, but other nations perfected the idea. The British mounted the mortar on a rotating platform so that it was no longer necessary to move the whole vessel to change aim. “The Star-Spangled Banner”, the US national anthem, commemorates these ships with the line “the bombs bursting in air.”</long_description_text>

<key>brig</key>
<description_text>A brig is a lightly armed, small, two-masted sailing ship, much prized for its exceptional handling and sailing qualities. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe term “brig” is a contraction of “brigantine” (an earlier sailing ship design), although the two types do not have the same rigging. A brigantine carries fore-and-aft sails, while a brig is square-rigged; this explains why the brig was favoured, for square rigging requires far fewer skilled hands to sail the vessel. The term “brig” could also include many rigging sets, including the strangely named “hermaphrodite brig”, which had a square-rigged forward mast and schooner-rigged aft (main) mast. \n\nAll brigs, in the hands of a good captain, are handy little ships, and can virtually turn in their own length. This manoeuvrability partly makes up for the light armament, usually no more than a couple of cannon – and those no larger than 12-lbers. The development of carronades (short-barrelled, short-range, large-bore weapons) added to a brig’s firepower. \n\nHistorically, the fledgling United States Navy used brigs, particularly on the Great Lakes. USN brigs also put up a brave account of themselves against the Barbary Pirates.</long_description_text>

<key>carronade_frigate</key>
<description_text>Carronade frigates are single-deck vessels, with extremely impressive short-range firepower.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nNormally frigates would be armed with long guns, probably no larger than 12-pounders. A few short-barrelled 64-pounder carronades might be aboard to give a close-in broadside more weight of shot. A carronade frigate goes one better, and carries nothing but carronades – short guns that are half the weight of the equivalent conventional cannon. While the weight of a broadside is truly awesome, the frigate has to get in close in order to blow an enemy to smithereens thanks to the carronades’ limited range. A clever enemy will stay out of range of the carronades’ horrendous power and take long range pot shots.\n\nHistorically, only the Royal Navy experimented with an all-carronade armament aboard HMS Glatton (in service from 1795). Glatton carried 28 64-pounder and 28 32-pounder carronades, giving a weight of fire that was more than 17% greater than HMS Victory could deliver at the Battle of Trafalgar! This massive firepower allowed her, on one occasion, to chase all eight vessels in a French squadron back into port. Oddly enough, the next two vessels to carry the name “Glatton” in RN service were also massively over-armed.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nCheyenne Dog Soldiers are master horsemen and use their skills to great effect. They  prefer to use their horses for swift transport rather than as war horses, dismounting to fight hand-to-hand. Dog Soldiers uphold an oath of unflinching bravery, and will stand fast even when the battle appears lost and all others have fled. They are ideal for a fast paced attack against a strategic enemy position where the enemy must retake the ground, and as a last line of defence when all hope is lost.\n\nThe Spanish conquistadores re-introduced the horse to the Americas (quite by accident), and the animals were soon adopted for war by the natives. They became integral in the day-to-day tasks of hunting and travelling across the plains, jobs which had previously been performed by dogs. Horses were so highly prized they even became trophies: warriors often had one horse that they prized above all others and used only for bison hunts. These horses were always tethered directly outside a warrior’s tipi, and were key targets for enemy raiding parties.</long_description_text>

Their individual skills on horseback seemed almost magical to their enemies: riding bareback, they could even pick up fallen comrades at the gallop! The Comanche were particularly fond of pinto horses, believing them to be sacred. Pintos were also supposed to give their riders invulnerability in battle.</long_description_text>

Traditionally, Cossacks are cavalrymen without peer, as might be expected of a steppe people, but they are equally adept at fighting on foot. They are personally brave, even headstrong, in the presence of enemies, something that can make them too eager to get into the fight.\n\nHistorically, Russians and other Eastern Europeans have had an ambiguous relationship with the Cossacks. There is admiration for their fighting qualities, yet a certain wariness of their wild nature. This has not stopped them being used as irregular troops by many nations. Even as late as the Second World War entire Cossack divisions were used by the Soviet Army, and then by the Germans who invaded Russia. Those Cossacks who served with the Germans (there were Cossack Waffen-SS divisions) were either killed in combat or captured and sent to die in labour camps.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Creek Horse Riders are capable of missile attacks or devastating charges into enemy units.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese mounted warriors are armed with muskets and axes; their strength lies in the flexibility these weapons give them on the battlefield. They can unleash a barrage of firepower on an enemy then use their axes to terrible effect when charging home. By targeting the enemy flank or rear, they can break units on their own.\n\nIn 1813 the Creek nation was divided by a civil war, that came to be known as the Red Stick War. The Red Sticks were Creek who believed the tribe should return to the traditional ways of life and reject American influences. When a group of Red Sticks were executed by the Creeks for killing two settler families it sparked a tribal war, with the Americans joining the fight. The Red Sticks lost, and Colonel Andrew Jackson forced the Creeks to cede twenty million acres of land to the US Government, regardless of Creek loyalties. Jackson later became President, and was responsible for the controversial Indian Removal Act of 1830.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These mounted warriors are armed with bows for skirmishing and axes for charging home.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCrow Horse Warriors can employ two tactics in warfare to great effect. Firstly, they can wear an enemy down with arrows; they can then demolish them by charging home and doing terrible work with their axes. Fear is a stranger to Crow warriors: the battlefield is a chance to prove that a warrior has mettle, and so improve his standing within the tribe.\n\nHistorically, the Crow gave recognition and status to individuals who had achieved much in war. They could take part in religious ceremonies, name children and gain rank and reputation within the tribe. Warriors who ‘counted coup’ against enemies would decorate their war shirts with rosettes, or wear wolf tails at the heels of their moccasins. Conversely, anti-social behaviour was punished: the Crow had ‘joking relatives’ whose job was to shame each other into behaving appropriately. If good behaviour wasn’t observed, the next step was exile, or the destruction of the offender’s lodge and belongings.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These extravagantly attired light cavalry are an extremely useful force for any general.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEasily recognisable by their distinctive animal skins and feathered shields, these troops are recruited from many peoples. They have an ethos of personal, rather than collective, bravery. The animal skins worn include wolf, leopard and bear pelts, and their winged shields are enhanced by attaching bird feathers to them. They are armed with scimitars, and these can cause terrible slashing wounds in hand-to-hand combat. The task of the scouts, though, is to avoid combat, seek out the enemy and return with news.\n\nHistorically, Deli infantry men and cavalry were irregular troops, and deli horsemen would often find employment guarding caravans and important dignitaries.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Harsh and unforgiving warriors are born in harsh and unforgiving lands. These men are as deadly as their deserts.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLiving in a desert makes a man tough and ruthless, or dead. The weak do not survive, and this fierce cull produces proud and dangerous warriors. Their battle skills have been honed by years of raiding and goat thievery, or against the more settled people of oasis villages. Defeat is unthinkable, because defeat is death.\n\nTraditionally, the Bedouin were among the most dangerous of desert tribes, fighting among themselves when outsiders weren’t available. Constantly on the move to find new pastures for their livestock, they learned to live with the minimum of possessions and little external support in the harshest of lands. Loyalty to tribe and family was all that helped a man survive.</long_description_text>

<key>dhow</key>
<description_text>A dhow is a traditional Arab sailing vessel, rigged with a lateen sail. Although an ancient design, it is an efficient and handy craft, particularly for coastal work – and pirates! </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe design of the dhow has remained unchanged over hundreds of years; it simply doesn’t need to be improved. Used throughout the Arab world as trading boats, pirates also favour them because of their good handling, and relatively high speed. That said, the design may well be Indian in origin, later adopted by Arab seafarers. A well-handled dhow has the advantage over many European rigged ships, in that it can stay out of the firing footprint of most lumbering ships and yet is quick enough to be able to escape in even the lightest of breezes. \n\nThe lateen (or triangular) sail is also ancient design. It is not, however, perfect for all conditions. The canted lateen yardarm is difficult to handle in stormy conditions with a small crew. This may explain why the sailing rig is favoured in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and around the Arabian peninsular rather than the Atlantic. The construction method of stitching the planks together is a unique feature of the dhow. \n\nHistorically, Europeans tended to use the term “dhow” indiscriminately to mean any vessel rigged with lateen sails. An Arab sailor would make a much finer distinction, based on the hull configuration.</long_description_text>

<key>east_camel_gunners</key>
<description_text>These camel troops are armed with large-bore long muskets, and all of them are crack shots.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike many desert troops, these men have learned the trade of killing in a hard school. The desert is unforgiving to those who are weak, and a man who cannot fight well is unlikely to survive the constant feuding and banditry that his neighbours will visit upon him. The scarcity of resources has also taught these men the value of making every shot count. When a bullet and a shot’s worth of gunpowder must be stolen, taken as loot or bought at enormous cost, a wise man makes sure that he only shoots at something he can kill.\n\nThese gunners carry very large muskets, with a bore the width of two thumbs on a grown man. Such a weapon is too large for any foot soldier to carry around in a desert, which is why these men fight as mounted infantry: riding into battle, then dismounting to deliver their devastating fire. Any wound from their weapons is likely to be fatal, even an apparently minor one in a limb: musket balls often have bubbles and flaws when they are cast which causes them to burst inside a target, causing horrendous injuries.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Camel nomads are lords of the merciless desert and few who face them there in battle live to tell the tale.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThere is no environment harsher than the desert, and the nomadic tribesmen who inhabit it are as pitiless as the shifting sands. The trackless sandy wastes are littered with the bones of those foolish enough to have ventured there in defiance of those who call this place home. Nomads are experts in using the desert to defeat an enemy before risking an attack, although they tend to fare less well in cooler climes. The nomads’ camels can withstand searing temperatures which would quickly exhaust a horse – and no horse is happy with the sound and smell of camels either!\n\nA common nomad tactic is to allow the intense heat of the desert to weaken their foe, then to thin their numbers with fire from their archaic-looking matchlocks. Despite their ancient appearance, these muskets are always well-maintained and used to deadly effect. Once the enemy has begun to falter, nomads risk a more direct attack, closing for the kill with their scimitars. The weird ululating battle cries favoured by the nomadic tribesmen are often amongst the last sounds heard by their exhausted and dispirited victims!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These fierce and independent men spend their lives fighting, making them superb irregular troops for a general they respect. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMountains breed men who are unforgiving to their enemies, suspicious of strangers and wary around their friends. Life is hard in the mountains, and it is easier to take something than build, grow or make it. Banditry, feuds, revenge and murder are a way of life for many, and the survivors of this harsh school of life must be tough and uncompromising in their hating. All this means that they superb in war: deadly shots and dirty fighters. Any governor who tries to impose order rapidly finds that hill folk may fight each other, but they will always unite against the outsider.\n\nHistorically, many outside powers have tried to tame the wilder elements in Kurdish and Afghan society but with mixed results. Alexander the Great gave up, even after marrying a Bactrian woman, Roxana. In 1842, for example, a 15,000-strong British column decided to withdraw from Afghanistan back to India. Only one man actually made it back to “civilization” alive.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Heavily influenced by European military thinking, Bargirs are a match to most line infantry regiments.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWith their equipment paid for by the state and their organisation based on tried and tested European principles, Bargir infantry are more reliable than most Indian foot soldiers. Armed with good muskets and often trained or led by mercenary European officers, Bargirs provide their general with a range of tactical options on the battlefield.\n\nTraditionally, armies on the Indian subcontinent were geared toward mounted troops who enjoyed a high status compared to infantry. Footsoldiers, mainly drawn from the lowest echelons of society, were typically a disorganised rabble, useful to a commander only because they added numbers to an army. They were expendable, poorly-equipped and easily-dismayed in battle, often making them a liability rather than an asset.\n\nThe social mobility which characterised Maratha society allowed a more modern view of the role of infantry to come to prevalence. Through observation of European methods, the equipment and training of Maratha infantry began to improve, allowing the successful use of advanced manoeuvres and firing drills.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musketeers are a useful addition to any force, even if they lack the fire discipline of regular soldiers. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFor all its smoke and noise, handling the smoothbore, muzzle-loading musket can be taught to all but the most stupid of men. Once the basic skills of loading have been mastered, it is simply a matter of pointing the loud end at the enemy and pulling the trigger. It is in God’s hands as to what happens next!\n\nEven the most inexperienced or cack-handed of peasants can be useful with a musket in his hands. The noise of a volley is often enough to frighten, and any casualties in the enemy ranks are a bonus.\n\nHistorically, such units of irregular musket men would arrive at a battlefield with all kinds of weapons, from ancient matchlocks handed down from father to son, to modern government-issue weapons looted from the enemy dead. This lack of standardisation did not matter much, as it was the ability to fire at all that made the unit a useful force.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough a sword, no matter what its design, may appear outdated next to a musket, it has one great advantage: it never needs loading. A truly skilled swordsman will never want for employment, and he is an intimidating sight to many regular musket-armed soldiers.\n\nUnits of swordsmen are also easier to handle tactically on a battlefield. A general does not have to make fine judgements about when to hold or give fire: he need only send his men forward to do their killing work at the right time. Once committed, they will keep fighting until death or victory comes.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These “feudal” troops are armed in traditional style and, while cheap, may not be as reliable as regular forces. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Zamindars, or landholders, recruit troops from among the peasantry farming the lands they manage. A life in the ranks is a little better than one toiling in the fields, and offers the chance of loot and excitement.\n\nAt first sight, the Zamindar system has much in common with the medieval “feudal” idea, and this was how many Europeans saw the system. A Zamindar would be given land to run as a tax farm, squeezing the peasants for all the revenue he could get. At the same time, the Zamindari would have a place in a formal hierarchy, and were expected to contribute a contingent of troops to the army. This sounds like the feudal idea of providing men to an overlord, but it was based on financial, not fealty, principles. There were even landholders who were expected to supply elephant troops rather than cavalry and footmen. When the European trading companies took over tax collection, they often left the local landholders to collect taxes, after weeding out the most glaringly corrupt.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThey are unswervingly faithful and proudly deserving of their elite status. Mounted on the finest horseflesh, they carry ornate lances into battle which are deadly when brought to bear at the charge. When delivered in the flanks or rear of an enemy formation, such a charge often proves decisive to the course of a battle.\n\nAs fief-holders, Sipahis are granted the income from a parcel of land in exchange for their military service, and they are also expected to supply a number of armed men. Highly disciplined and enjoying the high status common to many cavalry corps, Sipahis see themselves as superior to the sometimes unruly Janissaries, with whom they maintain a simmering rivalry. A contributing factor to this is that Sipahis are all ethnic Turks, whereas the Janissaries are of mixed stock, recruited as children from provincial Christian families and converted to the Islamic faith. Regardless of these petty concerns, Sipahis represent the best horsemen available to the Sublime Porte.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops ride into battle on the backs of elephants, beasts who very presence spreads terror throughout enemy ranks. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike many animals, elephants can be trained to ignore the sights, smells and, above all, hellish noises of a battlefield. They can also be trained to fight, goring men with their tusks and trampling others underfoot. Elephants make superb platforms for men to fight from, giving them an automatic height benefit over many opponents.\n\nThere are risks to using elephants in warfare. They do panic, and if they stampede they will cause terrible damage to everyone, friends and foe alike. Indian elephants, however, are relatively tractable beasts, and there is a long history of using them as beasts of burden. \n\nThere is also a long history of using unusual animals in combat, from elephants to war dogs, and even seals and dolphins in more recent times. Elephants at least stand a chance of survival, unlike the Russian mine dogs of the Second World War, who were trained to look for their dinners under enemy tanks. This doesn’t sound too bad, until you learn that the dogs were carrying explosive packs on their backs. Dinner time on the battlefield was always terminal for the dog and his target tank.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite light cavalrymen are used for skirmishing and are some of the finest horseman in the Prussian army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHussar duties include patrolling, gathering of information and denying the enemy the freedom to do the same. They also provide the valuable service of pursuing routing enemies, and their speed makes them a useful reserve to attack any enemy unit that is about to break. Bringing about such a crisis can make the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nHistorically, hussars in Prussian service were not large men, with a maximum height of 1.67 metres, possibly the result of their largely peasant upbringing; their horses were proportionally small. Their commanding officers were, however, under no such restrictions and were drawn from among the Prussian Junkers. General Hans Joachim von Ziethen started as an infantry officer, but transferred to the dragoons when his commander took a dislike to his “squeaky voice and mean, insignificant appearance”. Possibly because of these personal qualities he developed a reputation as a duellist and dissenter. This aggressive attitude served him well when he transferred to the 2nd Hussars and he was given command. He remained with the regiment for 45 years, even after promotion to general’s rank, until his death at 87.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Blue Guards are the elite bodyguard unit that serves the rulers of the Netherlands.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAll royal guards think of themselves as the elite of their national armies. Sometimes, they are court regiments where a martial appearance is valued more than real soldiering. The Blue Guards, however, have a tradition of fighting, and can shame any line regiment with their discipline and skill. This does not make them popular as they are, of course, all gentlemen and superior to any mere common infantry.\n\nHistorically, the Blue Guards began as the personal bodyguard to Protestant William of Orange (later William III of England and Scotland). They followed him as he drove out the Catholic King James II after the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688. They were at the forefront of the attack during the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690, wading across the river to fall upon James’ line. With William’s claim to the throne secure after James’ defeat, the Blue Guards remained his personal bodyguards until his death in 1702: William could not bring himself to really trust Englishmen. After his death the Blue Guards returned to the Netherlands, and resumed duties there, playing a key role in the War of Spanish Succession.</long_description_text>

<key>elite_bosniaks</key>
<description_text>Bosniaks are lancers, used to skirmish and for chasing down routing enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light-fingered cavalrymen are irregular forces, deployed where courage and speed are required, and mounted on the best horses. Their disciplinary shortcomings can be overlooked as long as they fight as if captained by the Devil himself! Looting is second nature to these men, and is (possibly rightly) considered a second source of pay. The other, unsavoury activities associated with pillage are equally considered a right, not a perquisite. This reputation for lawlessness often counts against them.\n\nAlthough they have their origins in the Balkans, as the name suggests, “Bosniak” lancers can include men from many nations. Historically, the prototype for this unit was raised by an Albanian, Stephen Serkis, who recruited a force of lancers originally intended for Saxon service. He then offered his men to Frederick the Great (1740-86) of Prussia. Even though Frederick thoroughly disapproved of irregular troops in Prussian service, he took them into his army, and later recruited Poles, Lithuanians and Tatars to replenish the ranks. The regiment was eventually amalgamated into various other light cavalry forces by the beginning of the 19th Century.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light infantry are used to harass the enemy and screen the main body of the army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOn the battlefield, they are skirmishers used to counter enemy light troops that cause problems to the highly regimented Prussian regulars. Those recruited into the Frei-corps include foreign mercenaries, ex-prisoners and deserters from other armies. Their less-than-reputable nature makes the Frei-corps perfect for raids and independent operations where the ability to live off the land (by stealing) is more important than parade ground drill. They travel light and their uniforms are deliberately plain to avoid drawing unwelcome attention.\n\nHistorically, Fredrick the Great (1740-86) had little respect for the Frei-corps. He was a believer in discipline and drill in soldiers, and the independence of light troops held little appeal. The men were basically sneaky and professional rascals and this was simply un-gentlemanly and dishonourable to the 18th Century mind. Frederick’s army was supremely disciplined, but even he had to accept that sometimes a certain “flexibility” was required, hence the Frei-corps.\n\nDespite the name, the Freikorps formed in Germany after the Great War had little in common with these 18th Century troops, as they were “free” brigades of anti-communist ex-soldiers, returning from the front with no prospects and little loyalty to the Weimar Republic.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Garde à Cheval are gentlemen of quality, hand picked from the best families, who protect the monarch.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Garde à Cheval are a court regiment where appearance is just as important as fighting prowess. The gentlemen of this unit (and they are all gentlemen) are not the common sort of soldier, and they are not respected by the rest of the army. Often, they are also unloved by the people too, as they stand with the monarch, and this can mean taking a sabre to their own countrymen.\n\nHistorically, from 1721 the Russian throne was protected by a mounted guard regiment, a unit drawn almost exclusively from the nobility. Because of their duties and control of access to the Imperial family, the Garde à Cheval had significant political power. Although drawn from the nobility, the original guards were not appointed for their military skills: as the bodyguards of the Empress Elizabeth, they were chosen for their other “endowments”. The Empress had a roving eye, and a taste for handsome young men of good blood. A certain kind of stamina was also required! This kind of behaviour merely served to confirm the prejudices against Russians in the more refined (or so they liked to think) royal courts of Western Europe.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite cavalrymen are mounted on large horses and armed with swords, and use shock and impact to break enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA court regiment, the Garde du Corps are part of the monarch’s personal household, but they are a useful force for any general. As part of a tactical reserve, they can attack wavering enemies, delivering the blow that drives them from the field. They should not be used for pursuit, a task better suited to lighter cavalry. Only a rash or extremely bold general would have them attack a prepared enemy: cavalry are usually not capable of breaking infantry formations without support.\n\nGiven the informal nature of many armies in the 18th Century, household troops were the only ones a monarch could rely upon in a crisis. The Garde du Corps of the Netherlands was a conscious attempt to copy the French Bourbon household troops, widely regarded as being the best in Europe. The French were often seen as military geniuses, from siege warfare and tactics to military fashion. It was far from outrageous for other crowned heads to ape the French Garde du Corps when looking to their own security.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nRenowned for their stoic resolve, Guard Grenadiers can be relied on not to break under the strain of battle. Apart from anything else, throwing grenades is a dangerous business, but potentially devastating to the enemy. Strength is also needed in hand-to-hand combat, and Guard Grenadiers are a useful force of shock troops to be hurled against a wavering enemy. Their skills and physical presence makes them intimidating, even before steel is drawn.\n\nThe 18th Century was a period when there were attempts to codify and define every aspect of military life to the smallest detail. Everything, from the smallest button on a uniform, to the way a man marched, was subject to discussion, regulation, and draconian punishment for deviation. The Polish Guard Grenadiers were subject to rigorous drill in every aspect of their training. The throwing drill for grenades had stances to be adopted when priming, igniting and throwing a grenade. Woe betide any Grenadier who did not follow the laid down procedure! Equally, woe betide any man who failed to dress to the appropriate standard, or behave as expected of a Guardsman!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Horse Guards are an elite heavy cavalry unit, with a fierce reputation and deadly sabres.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIt is the task of the heavy cavalry to break the enemy by shock. Simply put, the Horse Guards are expected to charge home and smash enemy ranks by weight and speed. They are not for chasing down enemies: this is the work of light cavalry forces. Instead, they are a battering ram, hurled over short distances against close-formed enemies in the hope of producing a breakthrough and further confusion. These highly trained cavalrymen lend a further touch of class, thanks to the role as part of the royal household guard, to the brutal business of a cavalry charge.\n\nHistorically, the Horse Guards remain a feature of the British Army although they now use tanks. Their name is attached to Horse Guards and Horse Guards Parade. This building complex was designed by William Kent and completed in 1755 and are still used by the Household Cavalry. Horse Guards Parade is the setting for ”Trooping of the Colour”, a practice that dates back to the 17th Century. A regiment’s colours (or flags) were a rallying point in battle and so they were shown to the soldiers so they would be recognised in battle. Today, the ceremony is used to celebrate the official birthday of the ruling monarch; at the time of writing Queen Elizabeth attends every year and takes the salute at the end of the parade.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hungarian Grenadiers are strong men with the ability to hurl a grenade with precision into enemy lines.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRecruited from the largest and strongest men available, grenadiers must be capable of throwing a grenade far enough away so that the subsequent explosion does not kill them! Even so, fuses are notoriously unreliable, and men sometimes die from premature explosions. Yet no matter how worrying grenades are for the grenadiers, they are definitely worse for the targets!\n\nGrenadiers, thanks to their imposing stature, are also used as close-quarters shock troops, as they have the edge in a melee over smaller men.\n\nHistorically, Hungarian Grenadiers were a sight to behold on the battlefield in their magnificent uniforms. Hungarian units in the Austrian army were raised by feudal levy. Although the Austrians had an integrated military, Hungary remained a separate kingdom, even though it shared a Hapsburg monarch with Austria. Military enlistment in Austrian service was originally for life; in 1757 limited service was introduced in the hopes of attracting better recruits and thereby improving the calibre of the soldiers. Men were allowed to enlist for a maximum of 6 years or for the duration of the any hostilities, whichever was longer.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Legion is a composite force of infantry, able to fight in a battle line and as skirmishers.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are professional soldiers, the best that can be found in the United States. Each man is trained to fight with guts, independence and determination. All are schooled in the tactics of formal, European fighting, where giving fire from rigid lines is the norm, yet they are also capable of fighting in a flexible, loose skirmish fashion that is ideally suited to war against the natives. The Legion may not be numerous, but it makes up for that in fighting spirit!\n\nThe Founding Fathers were very suspicious of armies and believed that a citizen militia was quite sufficient for national defence. Events proved them wrong. Formed in 1791 to fight the natives, the Legion was America’s first standing army. Under the leadership of “Mad” Anthony Wayne – so called not because he was insane, but because he was “mad for it” and always up for a fight – US units were properly trained for the first time. After Wayne was killed in 1796, his Legion was reorganised into more conventional infantry regiments, which still exist as combat units in the US Army today.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nArmed and equipped in the same fashion as line infantrymen with smoothbore muskets. They are, however, altogether more splendid fellows in uniforms cut from the finest cloth. Sartorial elegance is not the only mark of superiority, as these men are arrogant (with good reason), well trained, and terrifying soldiers. Any general is glad to have these men to hand, as they can be relied upon, unlike many line infantry units. They also make fearsome garrison troops as their loyalty to the throne makes them ruthless in suppressing dissent.\n\nThe Siemenovski Foot Guards were raised by Peter the Great (1682-1725) during his time at the Royal Lodge in Preobrazhenskoe. The Guard began as two Poteshyi companies Peter created to learn about the art of command. The Siemenovski Foot Guards proved themselves invaluable in Peter’s eyes, and further guard regiments were raised from among Russian nobles for years to come. The Guards were not just a military force: Peter used them as a political and administrative weapon. Officers were sent out to enforce Peter’s reforms across Russia.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nResplendent in bright red uniforms, the Swiss Guard is recruited in the cantons of Switzerland. Armed with smoothbore muskets, these men are not just a decorative, court regiment, but very capable warriors, certainly the betters of ordinary line infantry units. Their origins mean that they can be trusted not to involve themselves in French conspiracies. French monarchs are not the first to realise that foreign soldiers are often hated and distrusted more than the monarchy itself by many internal enemies! The Swiss Guard, therefore, live and die in the service of the throne because, viewed cynically, their survival demands it.\n\nIn August 1792, France was in turmoil. King Louis XVI (1774-92) was a hollow, hated figurehead. The Swiss Guard were his last line of defence, guarding the Tuileries Palace when the revolutionaries attacked. The Bourbons escaped, but hundreds of their loyal Swiss Guards were killed. Many survivors succumbed to their wounds or were murdered during the September Massacres. Finally, in 1821 a statue was erected in Lucerne to commemorate the sacrifice made by the Swiss Guard. It depicts a dying lion, symbolically protecting the French monarchy.</long_description_text>

Every Marine prides himself on being a fighting soldier first and foremost especially if he is an officer. This battle-winning spirit is a powerful weapon in the Marine arsenal, and these men will rarely, if ever, run from a fight.\n\nTraditionally, the US Marines claim to date back to 1775, and the establishment of the Continental Marines during the Revolution. These forces were disbanded when America won its independence, and the Congress was forced to raise new forces of a United States Navy and a Marines Corps in 1798 when war with Revolutionary France looked likely. The units were raised with such haste that they were given hand-me-down infantry uniforms, including the uncomfortable stocks that give the Marines their “Leathernecks” nickname. That war never came, but the Marines were in action within a short pace of time, proving their worth in fights against the Barbary Pirates. Marine officers wearing full dress uniform still carry a “Mameluke” pattern sword to commemorate these early successes.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough a court regiment and expected to be immaculate at all times, they are also capable field soldiers. Trained to fight in line of battle, they are far steadier under fire than any ordinary infantry and equally capable in close-quarters fighting too.\n\nHistorically, this bodyguard unit was originally raised in mostly Catholic Wallonia (now part of Belgium), a Hapsburg, and therefore Spanish, possession at the time. As with other royal families, it was considered safer to have outsiders as guards for the monarch rather than locals, who might put their local sympathies ahead of royal safety in times of crisis. The loss of the Spanish Netherlands meant that non-Walloons had to be accepted into their ranks, although the name and the tradition of loyalty to the crown were retained. The first intake of Walloons had all been big men, to act as shock troops, but by the middle of the 18th Century they had been remodelled as a royal guard, consciously aping the French Bourbon Swiss Guards to add dignity to the Spanish court, by then under another branch of the Bourbon family.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nSelf-defence was part of life in Elizabethan and Jacobean England. A man expected to look after his own family and property as the local parish constables were not necessarily a reliable police force. In some parishes the constables were either old men, or non-existent. Men were also expected to join the local fencibles or trained bands, a militia for the defence of the kingdom in times of trouble. Skill-at-arms was therefore not unknown in the general population, and these skills were taken to the New World by the colonists. In times of tension with the native tribes, the fact that the colonists could, if needs must, protect themselves, was useful.</long_description_text>

The rate of fire is slow, and the accuracy very poor, but massed ranks of arquebusiers firing volleys have long since replaced archers in armies throughout Europe.\n\nTo the natives in the New World, the thunderous sound and bright flashes spewing forth some invisible death struck terror in to the heart of the bravest warrior. It was not long, however, before commercial interest meant the colonists had sold gunpowder weapons to the natives.</long_description_text>

During the voyage to the New World, he incited mutiny and was locked in the brig, pending trial upon arrival. The ship’s captain - Christopher Newport - intended to have Smith executed, but, thanks to orders issued by the Virginia Company before the voyage had even begun, Smith was reprieved.

<description_text>A band of Powhatan spearmen led into battle by their fearless warrior chief, Wahunsonacock.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis courageous band of men draws their strength and courage from the inspiring presence of their leader, Wahunsonacock. His word is law. His warriors would follow him into any battle, even against the terrifying power of the arquebus. \n\nHistorically, Wahunsonacock was also known as Chief Powhatan. The English settlers took this name from the village in which his tribe lived. The word ‘powhatan’ means ‘at the waterfalls’, as the Powhatan village was built by the falls of the James River. Perhaps his most infamous deed was the attempted murder of Captain John Smith. This was supposedly prevented by his daughter, Pocahontas, and has been greatly romanticised over the years.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nA general can only do his duty properly if his bodyguard keep those rough and unpleasant fellows from interrupting his calm deliberations on how to kill as many of them as possible. Washington relies on these talented, and, more importantly, trusted men to protect him as he directs the battle. His presence on the battlefield can inspire men to fight - even in the darkest of times. \n\nGeorge Washington’s military career spanned the French Indian War and the American Revolution, but this was by no means the only achievement in the life of one of the founding fathers of his country. To this day, he is the only President in United States history to be elected with 100% of the votes. Before becoming President, Washington was the Commander-in-Chief of the United States army, leading it to victory over the British.</long_description_text>

Washington relies on these talented, and, more importantly, trusted men to protect him as he directs the battle. His presence on the battlefield can inspire men to fight - even in the darkest of times. \n\nAs a young General in the colonial army, George Washington was involved in many of the key events of the French Indian War. In 1754 he marched into the Ohio Valley with 200 men to help with the construction of a series of forts along the Ohio River. Later that year he would build Fort Necessity to protect against an impeding French attack. Shortly after, he was involved in a skirmish with French troops signalling the beginning of armed hostilities in a war which would last six long years.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Musket-armed troops who use massed volleys to break an enemy, relying on discipline to withstand any counter-fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese soldiers carry muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These are inaccurate weapons, effective only to around 200 paces when fired in volleys. The ability to fire and reload with machine-like regularity with comrades falling all around is what wins battles; that and an ability to fight in a variety of tactical formations. Any enemy foolhardy enough to charge their cavalry at this unit while they are in square will find them a tough target.\n\nThe 1st Delaware regiment came into being in 1776 under the supervision of Colonel John Haslet; they went on to fight in the Battle of Long Island in August of that year. Along with the 1st Maryland Regiment they were able to repel the British, allowing Washington and his troops to make a safe retreat. The Delaware were then forced to make a daring retreat through marshland while escorting 23 prisoners of war. Their action during this battle prompted Washington to appoint them his rear guard when he strategically withdrew his army from Brooklyn to Manhattan.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Elite infantrymen responsible for holding the line, these versatile troops are equally at home with muskets or bayonets.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBy their very nature, line infantry are vulnerable to bombardment from artillery and sniping from skirmishers; it takes a special kind of courage to stand and carefully fire volleys at the enemy then dispatch them with a bayonet charge. Extensive drill, training and battle have helped mould these men into soldiers, capable of dealing with the enemy on equal terms.\n\nHistorically, the 1st Maryland regiment was raised to protect the province of Maryland and came under the command of Colonel William Smallwood. In July 1776 the troops were assigned to the main Continental Army and in the months that followed they joined Stirling’s Brigade. They took part in the Battle of Guildford Courthouse, but it was at the Battle of Long Island that they earned their formidable reputation. They single-handedly covered the American retreat, holding off superior numbers of British regulars.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Trained in mounted and dismounted combat, this light cavalry unit is useful to reinforce cornered comrades.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhen a friendly unit is being harassed by an enemy beyond its fire range, these cavalrymen can react immediately, riding to the enemy to counter the threat. When mounted they are good in melee, at the charge, and can fire their carbines. They are not very effective in close combat on foot, leaving themselves vulnerable when acting as melee infantry.\n\nThe 2nd Continental Light Dragoons were one of the first cavalry units raised in 1776 following Washington’s realisation that the war was going to be far longer than expected. His original plan was to raise 3,000 horsemen, but it soon became obvious that paying and equipping that many horsemen was beyond the resources of Congress. Instead, four small regiments of light dragoons were raised. The 2nd light dragoons were commanded by Colonel Elisha Sheldon, who was commemorated for his efforts by the citizens of Sheldon, Vermont.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed troops use massed volleys to break an enemy, relying on discipline to withstand any counter-fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMarching or line regiments make up the majority of units in European-pattern armies. They are so-called because they form the line of battle, not because they deploy in lines. They can also form square, a particularly effective tactic against cavalry charges, although this leaves the unit incredibly vulnerable to artillery fire and skirmishers. This weakness aside, the versatility of a line regiment makes them a valuable addition to any force.\n\nThe 2nd New York regiment was raised in 1775 and placed under the command of Colonel Philip van Cortlandt. The van Cortlandt family history was already impressive: Philip’s great grandfather was the first American-born mayor of New York and the family name was used for various place names across America. Colonel van Cortlandt was promoted to brigadier general following acts of valour at the Siege of Yorktown. He lived out his remaining years as a politician, eventually dying at the age of 81.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops are responsible for holding the line, equally skilled using their bayonets or firing massed volleys.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe 33rd Foot are known as “The Pattern” for their stoic professionalism in battle; they are able to calmly pick targets and fire on them even while skirmishers’ shots whiz by their ears, artillery shells explode around them and cavalry charges bear down upon them. To guard against such devastating enemy charges they can move from line to square formation.\n\nThe 33rd Foot was originally raised in 1702 as the Earl of Huntingdon’s Regiment of Foot. It was not until 1751, when all regiments were numbered rather than taking their general’s name, that it became the 33rd Foot. They left England for America in May of 1776 and were part of the force that besieged Charlestown. They joined Howe’s New York campaign and took part in a number of key battles including Brandywine. Despite losses the 33rd Foot were able to break the American line, pursuing them for a full 2 miles. The regiment eventually became “The Duke of Wellington’s”, the only unit in the British Army named to honour a non-Royal.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These German dragoons are heavy cavalry, skilled in the use of sword and carbine.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBrunswicker dragoons are versatile troops; they have a powerful charge that can break enemy infantry formations, and can ride to critical spots on the battlefield to lend support to beleaguered allies. However, should they be pitted against infantry formed in square their charge will fall short of the power achieved by heavy cavalry units. They do have the advantage of being armed with carbine muskets, but they are trained to use these when on foot; dragoons should not be expected to engage in close combat effectively when dismounted.\n\nThe Brunswicker Dragoons (and other Brunswick units) left Germany for America under the command of Col. Friedrich Riedesel in 1776. When the dragoons arrived in America they did so without horses. They were paid as heavy infantryman and acted in this capacity for many of the early campaigns. At the Battle of Bennington most of the 120 men were either killed or captured, dramatically reducing the size of the unit. Those that did survive rejoined the main body of British troops after the surrender at Saratoga. This under-strength regiment remained in garrison duty in Canada until 1783, when it returned to Brunswick.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hessian Grenadiers are large, strong men, armed with muskets, grenades and a fearsome reputation.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGrenadiers see themselves as elite, and usually occupy the place of honour at the right of the line. They have every reason to be proud: only large, brave men become grenadiers. This size and strength makes them impressive and gives them an edge in melee combat. They are vulnerable when attacked by heavy cavalry and skirmish troops. This aside, grenadiers are dedicated soldiers who will follow orders to the letter.\n\nHistorically, Hessian soldiers were renowned for their skills and discipline. This is due, in part, to the harsh penalties imposed upon them for any indiscipline. Corporal punishment was a regular occurrence, minor offenses often being punished with clubs and cudgels! Another popular punishment was ‘the gauntlet’: a ritualistic beating that involved a soldier’s comrades gathering in two lines to beat the accused as he ran or walked past them. For more serious offences Hessian soldiers would be swiftly hanged. This treatment did not make them tolerant of any rebellious behaviour in others, including civilians.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Whether using their muskets or their bayonets, these infantrymen hold the line in battle.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis loyalist regiment is made up of line infantrymen who fire mass volleys into the main body of an enemy to break them. Once their ammunition is spent or the enemy is sufficiently weakened, they can fix bayonets and deliver a decisive charge. Because these men fight in close formation, they are vulnerable to long-range attacks by artillery and skirmishers, but they can counter cavalry charges by moving to a square formation.\n\nThe King’s Royal Regiment of New York was a misleading name for a regiment that was never actually stationed in New York. In fact, the men spent a great deal of their time in Montreal. The unit was originally comprised of colonists fleeing “patriot”, or rebel, persecution and in time they proved to be a very effective raiding party. This may have been thanks to the Native American warriors who often accompanied them in action. These warriors were led by their own chiefs, and the number attached to the regiment would vary in size depending on the campaign.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Speed and agility, coupled with the ability to fight on horseback or on foot, makes these men very useful in a fight.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFast moving and highly skilled, these men are truly skilled horsemen. They do not fire their carbines whilst mounted, however, preferring to ride men down and dispatch them with cold steel. These impressive collection of skills make them ideal for use against artillery and skirmishers. However, should they find themselves facing well-disciplined line infantry, formed in square, their weaknesses would swiftly become evident.\n\nLee’s Legion was commanded by Henry ‘Light horse’ Lee, the father of famed Confederate general Robert E. Lee. Henry Lee’s first commission was as Captain of the Virginia Light Dragoons. During his time as a captain he caught the eye of Washington while leading a series of successful raids on enemy supply trains. At Paulus Hook, New Jersey, he increased his renown by taking 400 British soldiers prisoner with the loss of only one of his cavalrymen. This action earned him a gold medal, an honour usually reserved for only men of general’s rank.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Morgan’s Corps are skirmishers and snipers without peer, picking off leaders to sow confusion in enemy ranks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOrganised as light infantry but armed with rifles rather than smoothbore muskets, riflemen have every right to see themselves as elite. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they do not need close supervision by their officers. These crack shots are trained for ranged combat and will be found wanting if they engage in melee. At their best in cover, their loose formation makes them a tough target for line infantry, and their uniforms allow them to blend into the landscape as they stalk their human prey.\n\nThe men of Morgan’s Provisional Rifle Corps were seen by many, including George Washington, as elite soldiers; they were well acquainted with the use of a rifle and were expert marksmen. This exceptional reputation meant they were chosen to accompany Benedict Arnold to attack Quebec. The attack began during a blinding snowstorm and ended in failure. Morgan did manage to get a few of his men over the wall and in to the city, something which no other American achieved.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThese cavalrymen, armed with lances, have a devastating charge, which is especially effective against enemy line infantry. Pulaski’s Legion is best employed to rush and break the enemy line, and then it should be pulled back for another charge before the enemy regains their senses. Despite their great initial attack, a wise commander will avoid leaving them in melee, as they are extremely vulnerable in prolonged close-combat.\n\nPulaski’s Legion was created by a Pole, Casmir Pulaski. He was forced to flee Poland after being implicated in a plot to kill the king; it was during his exile in Paris that Pulaski met Benjamin Franklin. Franklin convinced him to aid the emerging American army against the British, and Pulaski joined Washington’s army just before the battle of Brandywine. During the battle he led a scouting mission that discovered the British flanking movement. This act alone earned him the position of brigadier general of the American cavalry.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nLine infantry are responsible for holding the line in battle, forming the backbone of the army while specialist troops harass and chip away at the enemy. Once the enemy is worn down, the regiment can rush them with a finishing bayonet charge. Their close formation gives them strength when attacking, but leaves them vulnerable to artillery and harassing skirmishers. If under threat from cavalry they can form a defensive square.\n\nHistorically, the Royal Deux-Ponts take their name from the Duke of Deux-Pont who raised the regiment on his German estates. The regiment served throughout the Seven Years War and remained active after the war, while many long-established French units were disbanded. It went on to serve as part of the French expeditionary force that arrived in America in 1780 under Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nArmed with grenades and a powerful throwing arm, the Royal Welch Fusiliers are far more than your average missile troop. Their skills extend past the throwing of highly explosive projectiles, also encompassing the fine art of marksmanship, muskets being the weapon of choice. Although primarily expected to fight at range, fusiliers are also more than capable in melee and on the charge. Their only real weakness is artillery and heavy cavalry who could charge them from the flank or the rear.\n\nThe Royal Welch Fusiliers were founded in 1689. At this time they weren’t known as the Fusiliers: this title was not bestowed upon them until 1702. A further addition was to follow after the War of Spanish Succession in 1713, when they became the Royal Welch Fusiliers. This was a variation of “Welsh” used at the time. Later members of the regiment would earn 14 Victoria Crosses (the highest British award for gallantry) and can count famous servicemen and poets Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves amongst their number.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These elite marksmen are trained in wilderness warfare and taught to survive in harsh conditions.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRangers are used for scouting and raiding missions far beyond the skills of ordinary men. Their ranks are mostly drawn from frontiersmen already hardened to living in the wilderness and capable of hiding in a variety of terrain types. Excellent marksmen, they excel at ranged combat but suffer in prolonged melee attacks. They are trained to conceal themselves and fight in loose formation, but if caught in the open by line infantry or cavalry they are likely to sustain heavy casualties.\n\nHistorically, Fraser’s Rangers was a British brigade formed in Canada and composed of General Fraser’s 24th Regiment of Foot, with light infantry and grenadier units from Sir Guy Carleton’s Montreal force. These men took part in a number of key battles during the American Revolution, most notably the Battle of Bennington where they sustained heavy losses. They also fought at Saratoga, where they came up against Major General Morgan and his 500 elite riflemen. Morgan’s men were attacked by the British advanced company, but Fraser and his rangers drove them back, allowing the advanced company to retreat.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nNamed for Banastre Tarleton, also known as “The Bloody Ban”, these troops are ideal for countering enemies such as skirmishers and artillery. Tarleton’s dragoons have fast horses and can quickly reach enemies out of range of friendly line units. Upon reaching their target, they can unleash a cavalry charge or engage in melee. Dismounted, they can use their carbines to fire upon the enemy, although they are relatively vulnerable in close-combat.\n\nBanastre Tarleton sailed to America as a volunteer in 1775, quickly earning the rank of major for his bravery in the New York campaign. By the time Tarleton retired he had worked his way up through the ranks to general, and was even invested as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, a significant honour, for his efforts. Officially the 17th Light Dragoons, Tarleton’s troopers were the mounted element of the British Legion. At the time, the Legion was a mixed force of cavalry and infantry and was sometimes referred to as Tarleton’s Legion.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light cavalrymen are armed with carbines; it is their role to harass enemies with fire. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are a highly mobile unit, with enough long-range firepower to hurt many enemies; the pistols used by some cavalrymen are only really suitable for close-in fighting during a melee. Their carbines fire a smaller ball than the muskets of infantrymen, but it is still large enough to maim and kill a target. Having the speed of light cavalry, these men are a useful force for any general: they can be moved quickly to a key part of the line to give fire, and then redeployed with equal speed. They are also remarkably difficult opponents for heavy cavalry; it is hard to come to grips with an enemy who can simply outpace you!\n\nHistorically, the carbine was only a smaller calibre version of an infantry musket. The idea to cut down the barrel only emerged when it became clear that reloading a full-length musket on horseback was a horrible job, even if the enemy weren’t trying to kill you at the same time. Attaching the carbine to the user by a sling finally made it into a very practical, deadly weapon.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Recruited to fight in India, company cavalry are mercenaries fighting for the great trading companies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe officers and men in these units are Europeans, not locals, even though these regiments are raised in India. They are supposedly more reliable than native levies when defending European interests.\n\nCompany cavalry are equipped in European rather than Indian fashion; they fight as light, sabre-armed cavalry. Their tasks include acting as scouts, screening the main body of an army, and pursuing fleeing enemies – taking a sabre to someone already running away is likely to keep him running! It is not their main job to break enemy units or to fight other cavalry.\n\nBy 1700, the great European trading companies were so huge they could afford armies of their own, separate from the national army. The British East India Company, the Dutch “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC) and the French “La Compagnie française des Indes orientales” all had armies, fleets and forts in India and the far east. The Dutch felt it profitable to have one fifth of their employees in uniform, and the other companies were not far behind.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Raised in India, these European mercenaries do not fight “for king and country” but for the great East Indies trading companies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nCompany infantry are professional soldiers drawn exclusively from Europeans, both officers and other ranks. They are members of private armies for the traders, but one that is available to further national needs when required. They fight using European doctrine and equipment as line infantrymen, carrying smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets. These soldiers are also enforcers, tax gatherers and a potent threat against the local princes in India, even away from the battlefield. Native regiments under European officers exist too, but their reliability is doubtful.\n\nHistorically, the great European trading companies were often closer to being nations in their own right than business ventures. India was so wealthy that the companies needed armies, not just guards, to protect and expand their interests and prestige. The British East India Company (the “John Company”), the Dutch “Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie” (VOC) and the French “La Compagnie française des Indes orientales” all had their own armed forces; 1 in 5 VOC employees were soldiers!</long_description_text>

<key>euro_cuirassiers</key>
<description_text>Cuirassiers are heavy cavalry who still wear armour, who rely on the shock of impact to defeat enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese are big men, mounted on big horses, and their primary task is to crash into enemy forces and engage in hand-to-hand combat. To this end, they wear back- and breastplates over leather padding – the cuirass – and usually wear reinforced metal helmets too. Heavy straight swords are the weapons of choice. A wise commander with a cuirassier force under his hand keeps it as a battering ram to hit the enemy at the critical point.\n\nHistorically, armoured cavalry were the direct functional descendants of armoured knights and the three-quarter-armoured “lobsters” of 16th Century armies.\n\nDespite the military mania for neatness and order, nearly all cuirasses had a small dent in them. This was the proofing mark, where a pistol ball had been fired into the cuirass to “prove” that it worked as armour. A cuirass with a hole in it after this test would be thrown back into the furnace!\n\nCuirassiers still exist in modern armies, although their armour is now purely ceremonial. The French army still has two regiments of cuirassiers, the Italians have a Presidential Honour Guard, and technically the Household Cavalry in the British army are also cuirassiers.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_dragoons</key>
<description_text>Despite appearances, dragoons are not really cavalry but mounted line infantry, riding into a battle then fighting on foot.  </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHorses give mobility, not shock value in combat. Dragoons do not charge home, but ride to critical spots on a battlefield where infantry firepower is needed. They carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets with shortened barrels (to make reloading easier) originally called “dragons” or dragoons; over time, this name transferred to the men.\n\nDragoons are also useful for riot control and civil suppression (“dragooning” is to bully people into a course of action). Their usefulness as infantry and “cheap” cavalry means that they can put down all kinds of trouble, as cutting down civilians is beneath the dignity of proper cavalry regiments.\n\nHistorically, dragoons slowly became cavalry soldiers like any other, and stopped fighting as mounted infantry, although many regiments did retain the name. The cavalry had always regarded them as (lower paid) social inferiors, and the infantry had resented them as not being proper footsloggers, so the dragoons welcomed their new acceptability.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Light infantry forces form a skirmish line to slow the enemy advance and keep their own line unmolested by enemy skirmishers. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhether they are called light infantry, jaegers, tirailleurs or chasseurs à pied, it is the job of these men to screen the main battle line, harass the enemy and, if possible, pick off important men in the enemy’s ranks. Unlike their fellows in the line infantry, light infantrymen are trained to think for themselves, use the ground and cover intelligently, and not fight in rigid lines. Instead, they form a loose skirmish line and fire independently at their own designated targets. The effect is a constant, low-level barrage rather than the crashing thunder of a volley but the effect is quite deadly as officers and sergeants are picked off and removed from the fight. Against cavalry, however, their best defence is to withdraw to their own battle line.\n\nHistorically, the Austrians were widely regarded as producing the finest light infantry forces in Europe. Other nations did catch up, but in the case of Britain and France it was their experiences in fighting in North America that persuaded them of the wisdom of light troops. Battle lines were simply impossible to manage in the dense woodlands, and largely pointless against the native tribes!</long_description_text>

<key>euro_elite_light_infantry_croatian_grenzers</key>
<description_text>Grenzers are aggressive skirmishers, armed with an unusual double-barrelled musket.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light infantry are used to harass and disrupt the enemy as battle commences. Like other skirmishing forces, the grenzers consider themselves a cut above most infantrymen. They are expected to show individual aggression, initiative and soldiering skills, not just obey and fight in formation.\n\nUnusually, they carry heavy double-barrelled (over-and-under) muskets, allowing two shots before reloading. This innovative weapon doubles the firepower of a grenzer unit, compared to any other skirmishing force. Added to this, grenzers are taught to select their targets carefully, making them quite deadly opponents.\n\nHistorically, the Austrians had a tradition of creating high-quality light forces such as hussars and skirmishers. The grenzers were part of this tradition, recruited from among the Croat and Transylvania population of the Austrian Empire’s domains as frontier guards against the Turks. As frontiersmen, they had a certain air of lawlessness and even banditry, but they proved extremely able light troops and were used against Austria’s other enemies. Over time, however, they became a hybrid type between line infantry and skirmishers: often deployed in battle in the line, but with the ability to skirmish when necessary. As identifiable infantry units, the Grenzers remained in Austrian service until the end of the First World War in 1918.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Riflemen are skirmishers and snipers without peer, picking off leaders to sow confusion in enemy ranks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nOrganised and equipped as light infantry with rifles, not smoothbore muskets, riflemen have every right to see themselves as an elite. Chosen for initiative and intelligence, they fight without close supervision from their officers. Their uniforms set them apart in an age when soldiers dress like peacocks: they deliberately blend into the landscape so that they can stalk their prey.\n\nHistorically, the most famous riflemen, the British Greenjackets, carried infantry rifles designed by Ezekiel Baker. This muzzle-loading flintlock used a small ball from a tightly rifled barrel to give superb accuracy. There are accounts of riflemen holding targets for each other at hundreds of paces! It was a slow business to load the piece properly, as high-quality powder was carefully measured out and the bullet wrapped in a leather patch then tapped down the barrel to engage with the grooves. All of this could take a minute or more to do properly, but the resulting shot was deadly over astonishing ranges. Baker even carefully supplied a long “sword bayonet” so that the overall length of his rifle plus bayonet matched that of a line infantryman’s bayonet-tipped musket.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These skirmishers and scouts carry almost-silent airguns and are well suited to stealthy sniping and tactical ambushes.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWindbüchsenjäger are woodsmen, hunters and poachers – men with a good grasp of field craft. Their speciality is skirmishing, to disrupt enemy formations with harassing fire, or to stop the enemy doing the same to their comrades. Unlike other light troops, however, they carry airguns. These weapons give them a distinctly unfair advantage!\n\nApart from the fact that is silent, with no muzzle flash or smoke, the windbüchse (“wind rifle”) has a 20-round magazine and fires as quickly as the jäger can pull the trigger. The gun can drive a ball through a plank (or a man) at 100 paces, but the velocity of shots drops as the air reservoir empties. Austrian gunsmiths have produced a deadly, if delicate, weapon in the windbüchse! However, it needs a highly trained and very fit man to use it properly: pumping up the air reservoir is a huge effort.\n\nHistorically, these airguns were not a success. They were quiet, but they did not work after rough treatment, something that was inevitable in battle. Napoleon Bonaparte hated them and decreed that any captured “assassin” with an airgun was to be executed, not treated as a soldier.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_expat_infantry</key>
<description_text>Expatriate infantry are exiles in another nation’s service: men with nothing left to lose but their lives.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEurope is awash with exiles, the dispossessed that have taken up arms thanks to war, religious persecution and politics. Some fight to free their homelands and some because home is gone. A few fight for the romance of it all, and for glory and riches. All serve because it is a better choice than starving. Whatever their motives, expatriates are a useful source of men. If someone can carry a musket, there is a place in the ranks. There is always the suspicion that individuals who have turned their coats once may do so again, even though this is unfair to many. As a result, it is unusual for expatriates to serve under their own officers.\n\nDespite the fact that many in the ranks are intelligent enough to act as skirmishers, expatriate infantry carry smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets and usually fight as line infantry. It is easier to maintain discipline in such units.\n\nHistorically, expatriate infantry varied in quality. The Irish Catholic “Wild Geese” in French service fought well, especially against the English. The French Royalist “Chasseurs Britaniques” in the British army, did not relish battle and often deserted at the first opportunity.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The hand mortar can be used to place a grenade on a target beyond normal throwing range.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDespite its name, the hand mortar is more of a grenade launcher, with a wide barrel, typically of bronze, mounted on a musket stock so that it can be fired from the shoulder. This method of delivery offers increased range, but the weapons are temperamental and prone to misfires or bursting. This, coupled with the variable quality of the grenades fired, means that in the wrong hands a hand mortar can often be as much of a danger to the man firing it as to the enemy. Despite this, the grenade is a useful battlefield weapon when used against enemies deployed in cover, or for clearing choke points.\n\nHistorically the armies of the Ottoman Empire and Russia employed the hand mortar. In the Russian military, hand mortar detachments typically operated in support of the artillery, possibly because the unpredictability of the weapon made it unpopular among the line regiments! The Ottomans always treated grenades as a form of “thrown artillery”.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Grenadiers are large, strong men, armed with muskets and carrying bags of bombs to hurl at the enemy’s ranks.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nExplosive grenades are one of the oldest types of gunpowder weapon, and one of the most dangerous to use. Grenades are a simple cast iron ball, with a fuse sticking out of the top. Fuses are notoriously unreliable, and grenadiers can die as their own bombs explode prematurely. Yet no matter how terrifying grenades are for the throwers, they are infinitely worse for the targets! Grenadiers see themselves as elite, and occupy the place of honour at the right of the line on parade. They have good reason: only large, brave men become grenadiers, because it takes a big chap to throw one properly. Even their uniform makes them look bigger thanks to the pointed grenadier’s cap; a tricorne gets in the way of a good throw.\n\nHistorically, grenadier regiments and battalions began as ad hoc assault forces. All line infantry regiments had grenadier companies; collecting these sub-units gave commanders a useful group of heavily armed, aggressive and skilful soldiers. Grenadier companies remained in line infantry regiments after the creation of grenadier regiments, but they abandoned grenades. Instead, each grenadier company became a “heavy mob” of the biggest and strongest soldiers in a regiment.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These cavalrymen see themselves as elite. It is their job to smash into enemy units and destroy them utterly.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHeavy cavalry are so called to distinguish them from the light cavalry forces. It is not the job of heavy cavalry to pursue enemies. It is their lot to use their speed and weight directly against enemies, battering them into breaking by shock of impact. To this end, they are usually armed with fearsome heavy swords that are quite capable of skewering a man or carving him in two. This role often means that heavy cavalry are held as a reserve by a wise general, so that they can be used to batter a hole in a critically weakened part of an enemy line.\n\nHistorically, there was debate during the period about the purpose of cavalry forces. Some generals favoured having their men close with the enemy and use “cold steel” for its terrifying morale impact. Britain’s John Churchill favoured this approach, keeping his men short of ammunition while on campaign so that they weren’t tempted to use any bullets in battle! The other school of thought, naturally enough, favoured using cavalry firepower to break enemy formations. Heavy cavalry did, therefore carry carbines and pistols, depending on the army they served in.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These fierce Highland warriors intimidate all enemies with their wild skirling attacks and barbarous apparel. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nHighland clans are the last tribal society in Western Europe. Men fight for their chieftains because they are expected to defend their clans’ honour and lands. They fight for these in the same way that they have done for centuries: with the broadsword and buckler, pistol, and Lochaber axe. There is little that regular line troops find as disturbing as the sight of a clan bearing down on them, screaming their hate and defiance. Highland Scots are brave, hard men.\n\nHistorically, the clans were destroyed as a military force at Culloden in 1746, by both British regulars and other, loyalist clansmen. The romance of the clans died on the field, along with a great many men who hurled themselves into a storm of lead and cannonballs armed with nothing more than swords. The clansmen were then repeatedly betrayed and used by their own chiefs, and then eventually driven off the land when sheep became more profitable. Highlanders were forced to scatter across the world, taking their fighting traditions with them.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are light cavalry, used as skirmishers and for scouting ahead of an army. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese superb horsemen are a force that can be used as a screen by the main army, or for strategic scouting to locate the enemy. They are armed with curved sabres and smoothbore carbine muskets. Their gaudy, almost popinjay uniforms should not lead enemies to underestimate them as mere dandies – these are trained, disciplined and dangerous soldiers. \n\nHussars have a certain swashbuckling attitude towards the business of warfare, and the bandit origins of the Hungarian “huszárok” are certainly evident. Even non-Hungarian hussars cultivate a slightly barbarous air, and little private or enemy property is safe when they are around! Oddly, they are also unusually democratic, and troopers expect to be consulted by their officers before attacking the enemy, again probably a legacy of their brigand heritage. \n\nHistorically, many nations adopted hussars after the Austrian type proved successful, and military fashions were also influenced by the hussars’ splendid and elaborate uniforms. Hussar uniforms became slight caricatures, but remained very fashionable and popular, particularly with ladies – perhaps it was the very tight breeches that were so appealing.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Hussars are light cavalry, used to skirmish and for scouting ahead of an army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike other light cavalrymen, hussars have speed, “dash” and an elitist attitude towards enemies. Hungarian hussars are, without exception, superb equestrians, as might be expected for a Magyar force. Their organisational origin as irregular forces (reputedly recruited from among brigands) gives them a certain independence of spirit, something that aids them in reconnaissance work. They carry a curved sabre and a muzzle-loading smoothbore carbine. This is a smaller calibre weapon than an infantry musket, the “sawn off” length of carbines being a late development to make reloading on horseback an easier exercise.\n\nAustria had raised units of irregular Magyar horsemen called “huszárok” in the mid-15th Century, and they had fought bravely for Matthias Corvinus, the King of Hungary and Croatia and Duke of Austria, but it was not until the 1680s that regular hussar regiments were formed. Having proved their utility in Austrian service, other nations soon added hussars to their own armies – and enthusiastically adopted hussar uniform as a fashion statement for cavalrymen. In some armies, hussar uniforms grew ever more gaudy, exaggerated and, frankly, needlessly suggestive in the cut of the very tight breeches! The cavalrymen didn’t mind at all that they were being dressed up like peacocks, as a splendid uniform was always useful in attracting the ladies!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These cavalrymen are armed with a long spear or lance that makes them particularly deadly when charging. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe lance is probably the oldest cavalry weapon. It gives the user a chance to put all the momentum of himself and his charging horse into one very sharp point that can, in the hands of a skilled man, be driven right through any man. This is what makes lances so intimidating to face but, if the lancer does not kill his target, he is then vulnerable. A long lance is a good deal less use in a melee than a sword, and a lancer is at a disadvantage once the close fighting starts.\n\nHistorically, many nations used lancers, although the European fashion for them owes much to the uhlans: cavalry raised for Austrian and Prussian service. The French adopted lancers with some enthusiasm, and Napoleon even included Polish lancers in his Imperial Guard. In India the lance had long been used as a weapon, and lancer skills were often improved by “pegging” (picking tent pegs out of the ground with the lance tip) or pig-sticking (hunting wild pigs or even wild dogs with the lance). Native Indian lancers were rightly feared by European troops.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_light_cavalry</key>
<description_text>Light cavalry are used to screen an army and act as its eyes and ears; they can also pursue fleeing enemies and keep them from regrouping.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese horsemen have many national titles, and military fashion plays a huge part in their employment and naming: light horse, chasseurs à cheval, chevau-légers, even hussars and dragoons are used as titles by light cavalry forces. Regardless of the name, their purpose, tactics and equipment usually have much in common. They disdain armour, even the sensible steel skull caps favoured by many beneath their officially sanctioned tricornes and helmets. They carry swords, carbines and pistols, but they are not expected to charge home, merely harass and pursue enemies. Their horses are always fast with good endurance, well bred and well looked after: a cavalryman without his horse is, after all, useless.\n\nTraditionally, light cavalry forces also undertook the role of communications for an army. Their speedy horses made them ideal for carrying messages between camps, or as gallopers on the battlefield. They were also among the most “dandified” of soldiers, and light cavalry uniforms of the period are some of the gaudiest ever created. This made recruitment easy, because prospective troopers could see what a dashing figure they would cut for the ladies!</long_description_text>

<key>euro_light_dragoons</key>
<description_text>Light dragoons are mounted skirmishers, riding to a fight then engaging the enemy on foot.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nTheir horses are for mobility, not for any shock value in battle and are often little better than nags and ponies, rather than decent warhorses. In battle, this is unimportant as light dragoons dismount and form a skirmish line to harass an enemy and screen the main body of their own army.\n\nThe main weapon carried is a shortened musket, originally termed a “dragon” or dragoon (like “rifle”, the term came to be applied to the man carrying the gun). This is not an accurate weapon, but is no worse than any other smoothbore.\n\nLight dragoons are also useful in suppressing riotous and rebellious civilians. Their horses give them strategic mobility, allowing them to police large areas effectively and come to the aid of the local authorities.\n\nHistorically, dragoons lost their role as mounted infantry over the course of the 18th Century, and became another kind of light cavalry, although they retained the name. The officers and men welcomed the change to a role that had a higher social status (and usually better pay rates).</long_description_text>

<description_text>Light infantry are skirmishers who harass the enemy while screening the main body of an army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nInitiative, aggression and pace of action mark these men out and they consider themselves a cut above other infantry, regardless of the title that they use. Light infantry, jaegers or chasseurs do not mindlessly follow orders, but pick and choose their own ground and targets, using such cover as they can find. They carry standard smoothbore, muzzle-loading muskets, but they do not rely on massed volley fire: they deliberately aim (as well as they can, given that muskets lack sights), at individuals within the enemy ranks. This selective fire can disrupt enemy formations or drive off enemy skirmishers. Over time, developments in tactics and weapons will make them very effective as snipers as well as covering forces.\n\nIn 1700, many European nations did not recruit light infantry regiments. Each line infantry regiment had a light company, but the mass volley was the proper way to employ firepower. As irregular light troops proved their worth and tribal natives refused to co-operate by fighting formal, set piece battles, it was realised that collecting together light companies in ad hoc regiments was no longer enough. Direct recruitment of light infantry regiments began in earnest, and by the end of the 18th Century every army fielded fast, light regiments.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_line_infantry</key>
<description_text>These musket-armed troops use massed volleys to break an enemy, relying on discipline to withstand any counter fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\n“Marching regiments” or “line battalions” make up the majority of units in European-style armies. They are so called because they form the line of battle, not because they always deploy in lines. Indeed, over time the capabilities of line infantry should improve as new tactics, drill and weaponry are developed.\n\nThese soldiers carry muzzle-loading, smoothbore muskets firing lead balls as wide as a man’s thumb. These are inaccurate weapons, effective only over 200 paces or so and when fired in massed volleys. The ability to fire and reload with machine-like regularity with shot and bullet flying and comrades falling all around is what wins battles.\n\nHistorically, in many armies colonels received a fee to raise regiments, which remained their personal property and commands. They jealously guarded their rights to appoint friends, relatives and hangers-on as regimental officers. This contractor system, however, allowed unscrupulous officers to make handsome profits by pocketing the pay of non-existent soldiers. The better colonels did take a pride in their regiments, spending their own fortunes on good uniforms and weapons. The capabilities of a “standard” line infantry unit therefore varied between nations and over time. It wasn’t until the 1760s that anything approaching uniformity of drill, equipment and regulations became the norm.\n\nLine infantry regiments remained unchanged throughout the period, and their organisational pattern still forms the basis of modern military units.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed troops are recruited to defend their own locality, not carry the war to an enemy’s land. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMilitia or provincial troops are commonly held to be inferior to regular soldiers and, although they are trained to use the same tactics as marching regiments of the line, there is some truth in this assertion. Militia are expected to act as reassuring presence, and sometimes as a police force in suppressing local disturbances.\n\nHistorically, it was not unusual for militia to be locals recruited as part-time soldiers while retaining their day jobs and trades. In Britain, for example, service in the militia was seen as a good idea: you not only looked very patriotic for volunteering, but you could not be sent overseas! For ambitious would-be officers, there was a hidden financial benefit to joining the militia. A commander who could persuade his men to transfer to the army with him would not have to pay the cost of his regular commission.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_militia_infantry_minutemen</key>
<description_text>These self-appointed militiamen are expert shots and fight as irregular infantry, often under officers chosen by the men. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMinutemen are so called because they pride themselves on being ready to defend their homes and families within a minute of being alerted to danger. This somewhat optimistic claim should not, however, underestimate their ability to inflict damage on enemies with their long rifled muskets. They are adept at using what cover is available, and at sniping from that cover.\n\nHistorically, the minutemen were among the first American forces to engage British regular troops during the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Their thoroughly unsporting habit of not standing in line to get shot was much despised by their British opponents. Had the Geneva Convention applied at the time, the minutemen could have been shot out of hand as “illegal combatants” because they certainly did not wear uniforms.\n\nIt can be argued that the success of the minutemen gave rise to the Second Amendment of the US Constitution (the right to keep and bear arms), although it is often forgotten that the text mentions a “well regulated militia” as “being necessary” which, it could also be argued, might not be quite the same as everyone who wants one having a gun. The name “Minuteman” was recently revived as the name of a nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile in USAF service.</long_description_text>

<key>euro_pikemen</key>
<description_text>Pikemen carry long spears of a type that would have been familiar to the soldiers of Alexander the Great. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nDespite the fact that firepower is the key to battle, “trailing a pike” into battle is more gentlemanly than carrying a gun. Pikemen are shock troops, relying on mass and impact in melee. Pikes are not without their uses: a solid wall of spear points is a formidable barrier to any cavalry attack. Pikemen still march into battle because not every European nation can afford (or find) enough guns for everyone. Sending men into battle with an obsolescent weapon is better than sending them forward with nothing at all.\n\nBy 1700, most European generals realised that the pike and pikemen were hopelessly outdated and outclassed on a modern battlefield. Pikemen had been a vital part of all infantry formations, protecting musketeers from cavalry and being the “shock” element in melee combat. There was a fatal problem for pikemen: a musket could kill at a distance, and once a decent bayonet was developed, pikes really did lose their point!\n\nAlthough a brilliant general in every (other?) respect, Maurice de Saxe, the great Marshal General of France, remained an advocate of the pike even in the 1740s. By then, it was obvious that pikes were useless against massed musket-armed infantry.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Polish Winged Hussars make a brave sight in any battle, their wings giving them an imposing and intimidating appearance. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese troops are usually members of the nobility, for only they can afford the expense involved in being a member of this prestigious force. They are armed with long lances, sabres and pistols for fighting at close quarters. Their armour and elaborate uniforms, complete with two towering, feathered wings, set them apart from other “hussars”, and make them appear to be a kind of cuirassier to the uneducated eye. Their charge with levelled lances and fearsome appearance is enough to strike terror into many foot troops.\n\nHistorically, the Polish Winged Hussars had been inspired by the successes of the Hungarian hussars. Over the centuries since their establishment, they became a heavier, armoured force and, if possible, even more convinced of their elite status. The truth was somewhat different: as the 18th Century dawned, the Winged Hussars were outmoded and, in the face of disciplined firepower, no longer quite as effective as they had once been.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These locally recruited cavalry are a valuable aid in keeping order.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese light horsemen are often little more than mounted militia, but with a greater social standing. Cavalry always see themselves as better than footsoldiers, but in this case, it may be true. It is, after all, not cheap to purchase and maintain a decent horse, and this means that men with financial standing make up the majority of recruits.\n\nThey are, however, not as disciplined as regular cavalry, simply because they do not have the time or available resources to learn the craft of war as thoroughly. They are, however, extremely useful in policing the rougher, lower orders and keeping the existing social structure intact.\n\nHistorically, there are many examples of yeomanry or gendarmes turning on their own citizenry with surprising and horrific violence. They were widely used against the anti-factory Luddites in northern England and, most infamously, were responsible for the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, when the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry charged a mostly peaceful, but excited crowd, and cut down many unarmed protestors.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nRangers are used for scouting and raiding missions far beyond the skills of ordinary men. Their ranks are mostly drawn from frontiersmen already hardened to living in the wilderness, as their experience making them ideal for further training. The wild nature of their environment is reflected in the unconventional tactics they are taught, and they are given some leeway where formal army discipline is concerned.\n\nHistorically, rangers were employed by the British army and were used in the hostile environments of North America during the French and Indian War. They would carry out long distance winter raids using crude snowshoes to travel. The most famous and revered of all rangers were the “Rogers’ Rangers”, named for their commanding officer, Robert Rogers. The traditions of Rogers’ Rangers are carried on today by the US Army Rangers, although the modern unit owes its existence to the Second World War experience of US troops fighting alongside British commandos and a reformed force in the Korean War.</long_description_text>

A colonel could choose his own officers by selling commissions or by appointing his friends and cronies to the posts. He also had a free hand over drill, uniform and horses for “his” regiment, and it was not unknown for unscrupulous men to have a few “ghosts” in the regiment so that their pay could be claimed from the government and kept by the colonel. Given that the regiment was “his” property, it was also not unknown for a colonel to argue with his general if his men were ordered to carry out dangerous, unpleasant or low-status tasks. A colonel had his honour and profits to consider, after all.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These men are legally compelled to serve in the army, on pain of imprisonment or death. As a result, they may not be the most enthusiastic of soldiers!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nConscripts are usually given basic training of a kind; a measure of drill instruction and enough knowledge of their weapons so that they are less danger to themselves than the enemy. However, it is often impossible to instil military skills and virtues in men who do not want to be in the army, and for this reason their grasp of even elementary tactics may be scant. This can cost lives in battle, as the use of conscripts is to march them towards the enemy en masse, and hope that the enemy cannot kill them all.\n\nConscription is an easy method of recruiting troops, by simply compelling the adult male population to join the army for a set period or until an emergency ends. Usually, there are enough special exemptions so that the moneyed classes do not have to join the ranks. Conscription is not without its costs: as men are swept into the ranks, the supply of labourers and even skilled workers can vanish almost overnight.</long_description_text>

They are, however, considered to be elite, as they are chosen for their devotion to the national cause and for their personal courage. In a republic all men may be equal, but the guard are more equal than other soldiers!\n\nIn much the same way as a royal or household guard would do in a monarchy, this force also has a ceremonial role, giving protection to the head of state. Their presence at formal occasions adds gravitas to the business of the republic. A republican guard is different from a royal guard in one other respect: it can include political officers in its ranks, whose main job is to watch for signs of disloyalty.\n\nHistorically, the “palace guard” sometimes became the only unit a leader could rely on when politics got out of hand, most of the time. It was not unknown for the guard to take the role of “kingmakers”, even in a republic, and only give their protection to a presidential candidate of whom they approved.</long_description_text>

Loyal without question, their familiarity with local culture allowed Europeans to fight insurgencies and unrest with understanding as well as brute force.\n\nThe sepoys of the British East India Company were typical in that they had native and European officers. “Natives” never commanded Company battalions, but their opinions were always sought by the better sort of European officer. The Ghoorkas were a special case, because Nepal was never colonised, but a treaty was made between the company and the native king.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The reputation of these elite soldiers and the example they set provides encouragement to comrades nearby.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are a cut above the average line infantry regiment and they are often the lynchpin of a commander’s battle strategy. The presence of such men in the line of battle is enough to lift the hearts of all those around them, strengthening their determination to resist any enemy. A general can be confident that these men will hold, and he can base the rest of his strategy around that fact.\n\nThe factors which lead a regiment to acquire an exalted position within its country’s military are hard to define: training and skill play their part, but in the main it is physical and mental endurance that keeps good men fighting even when the tide of battle is against them. A lucky few carry such strength within themselves, but others derive it from the proud martial traditions of their regiment. In Europe, the famous ‘vieux’ and ‘petits-vieux’ regiments of France have centuries of such history to call upon, whilst the various deeds of the British Coldstream Guards and Black Watch regiments reinforce the natural grit of the men in their ranks.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Ferguson Riflemen are scouts and snipers, who harass the enemy by targeting officers and leaders. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMajor Patrick Ferguson’s remarkable and patented flintlock rifle is a breech-loading weapon, with a cunning screw mechanism that opens the breech for loading and still seals the chamber tightly for firing. In the hands of a well-trained man, firing the piece is rapid; the laborious business of muzzle loading is no more! The rifling makes it accurate and deadly!\n\nHistorically, Ferguson intended his gun to go into the hands of an elite force, under officers of enterprise and daring, who would move rapidly, use cover, and could deliver accurate and withering fire. In practice, the weapon was not a success, because it was difficult to manufacture in quantity and somewhat fragile in the rough conditions of a battlefield: the screw mechanism would jam if not treated with respect. After Ferguson was wounded in action, his critics lost no time in equipping the unit with Brown Bess muskets, and then eventually disbanding Ferguson’s prize riflemen.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A galleon is a square-rigged warship, capable of long ocean voyages and of carrying some cargo. Demi-culverins are the usual armament carried. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nA galleon is a strong, seaworthy vessel, capable of surviving an Atlantic crossing in the worst of weathers. This is a tribute to their builder’s methods and techniques, learned over the decades of making caravels and carracks. The lines of a galleon show its medieval heritage, as the type is similar to the earlier ships, but without their high forecastle shape. The galleon retains a high stern castle, but its main fighting power is on the gun deck. This change meant that galleons are not fighting platforms for (land) troops, but fight with broadside batteries of demi-culverin cannons. In this respect, it is a forerunner to the later square-rigged rated ships of the line. The guns and strength of construction make them dangerous targets, as numerous English pirates and privateers discovered to their cost.\n\nA galleon can also carry a substantial cargo. The Spanish galleon fleets carrying bullion from the New World, for example, made a tempting target because they were such good cargo vessels. The wealth they imported was almost beyond calculation. The gold and silver, however, damaged the Spain by flooding the country with “cheap” money, and there was no understanding of economics to help stop the problem.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A Fluyt is a design for a square-rigged armed merchantman that is faster and handier than a galleon.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe ship is a good sailer, as befits a design coming from a seafaring nation like Holland.\n\nHistorically, the fluyt was originated by Dutch shipbuilders, and the type helped the Dutch to become a maritime trading nation in the 17th Century. Extensively used by the Dutch trading companies, it was soon adopted by other nations. The vessels were easy for a relatively small crew to handle, and could carry around a dozen cannon for self-defence, although these were sometimes left ashore so that even more cargo could be carried.\n\nThe fluyt had a distinctive “fat-bottomed” cross section. This was a cunning scheme to avoid taxes and tolls, as the Danish had a habit of charging tolls based on deck area for access to the straits between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. A small deck (the big cargo hold below counted for nothing) meant lower taxes! The Dutch had to pay these tolls if they wanted access to any of the lucrative Baltic trade.</long_description_text>

<key>gorodskiye_streltsy</key>
<description_text>These light soldiers are the traditional guardians of Russian towns, part militia, part police and part fire brigade!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe viborniye (“electives” who have chosen to serve in the ranks) and gorodskiye (municipal) streltsy are both hereditary militia. Originally raised from the ranks of tradesmen by Ivan the Terrible, they are an old-fashioned and traditionally-minded group. Over the centuries, membership of the streltsy has been passed down from father to son, and a lack of new volunteers – new blood – has ossified the old ways of battle. The streltsy are reliable, however, in defence of their homeland.\n\nHistorically, the streltsy posed a significant challenge to the young Peter the Great (ruled 1682-1725). Angered by changes to the army which removed their traditional privileges (of having an extremely easy life), the streltsy attempted to overthrow Peter. In 1698 they marched on Moscow, intent on replacing him with his sister, Sophia Alekseyevna. Previous attempts to change the system had usually provoked riots by the streltsy – the very people supposed to suppress such trouble – or worse. This time, Peter’s new-model “Western”-fashion forces crushed them. This was not the end to the streltsy, however, as Russia’s precarious position during the Great Northern War (1700-21) meant that Peter had to recall them to the colours.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The elite foot guards are charged with protecting the persons of the monarch and the royal family. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese troops are equipped in much the same way as line infantrymen, and carry smoothbore muskets as their primary weapons. There, however, the similarities end. Their uniforms are altogether more splendid, marking them out as a superior force, in arrogance if nothing else. This attitude can serve them well in battle, as the guard can hardly be seen to be cutting and running, no matter how hot the enemy fire. They are also expected to do a good job as garrison troops, keeping the royal family safe no matter what the locals might think or be tempted to do by some foolish revolutionary fervour.\n\nHistorically, the French Maison du Roi (literally “house of the king”) were the epitome of household troops. They provided a ceremonial guard at every state occasion, and Louis XIV picked them from candidates sent in by each regiment; inappropriate candidates brought punishment on the officers who had sent them! The Prussian “Potsdam Giants” were a quirky household guard, the product of Frederick I’s obsession with very, very tall men and military pomp. Oddly, he wasn’t a very warlike chap at all.</long_description_text>

<key>guerillas</key>
<description_text>These men are not soldiers, but civilians driven to take up arms against their nation’s enemies.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nGuerrillas are not a recognised military organisation at all, but bands of friends and neighbours who have adapted banditry to be a way of making war. They fight hard, because if they are captured they can expect little mercy from an enemy: at best, a trial before inevitable execution. War and vendetta are often the same thing for guerrillas: wrongs done and the resulting hatred are what drive them to fight. They are best when employed in ambush, or to skirmish and harass. They cannot be expected to fight in carefully dressed lines like soldiers, because they are not soldiers.\n\nHistorically, the Spanish people had an enormous capacity for carrying on wars against foreign occupiers long after their rulers had capitulated or made their peace with an enemy. Guerrillas arose as an act of rebellion. The name itself is Spanish, and means “little war”: the constant skirmishing and sniping that wears out an occupying army. When his men were bogged down there, Napoleon described Spain as an “ulcer”, thanks in part to the constant partisan warfare carried on by the guerrillas.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The royal guard cavalrymen are all gentlemen, hand picked to protect the person of the sovereign. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nRoyal guards are elite, but they are also a court regiment where appearance is as important as fighting ability. As gentlemen they are hardly expected to associate with the common sort of soldier, and this does not make them popular or respected with the rest of the army. They are also often unloved by the general populace too, as they are the last line of defence for the royal family, and this may mean that they are sometimes required to turn their swords on their countrymen to put down domestic trouble.\n\nHistorically, perhaps the oddest sounding of the various royal guard cavalry regiments were the curiously named horse grenadier guards. Common sense would seem to indicate that these men would only ever get to throw their grenades once, before their horses took off at speed towards all points of the compass! In British service the Household Cavalry regiments did not, and do not, have sergeants: they have a rank “corporal of horse”. The word “sergeant” has the same origins as “servant”, and no gentleman, even a private trooper, is ever a servant.</long_description_text>

<key>indiaman</key>
<description_text>The Indiaman is an armed merchant ship, strongly built for the trade routes between Europe and the East. It is not a warship, but can defend itself in need.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe Indiaman is a three-masted, square-rigged sailing ship of some 1000 tons displacement. Although work for the relatively small crew is hard, there are compensations: they can trade goods in their own right, and make excellent profits by doing so. \n\nUnusually for a merchant ship, an Indiaman carries cargo, passengers, and a good number of guns. Intended to sail from Europe to the other side of the world and back carrying valuable – sometimes priceless – cargoes, these ships have to be able to defend themselves. The passengers expect some creature comforts, being both officers of the owning trade companies and assorted “gentlemen” seeking their fortunes in foreign parts.\n\nHistorically, East Indiamen resembled ships of the line, both in their general configuration and paintwork. At the Battle of Pulo Aura (1804), the ambiguous appearance and aggressive handling of a squadron of British Indiamen completely humbugged the French admiral, Charles-Alexandre Linois. He withdrew in the face of “superior” forces. Commodore Nathaniel Dance, of the British Company fleet, received a knighthood and a handsome reward for his cunning.\n\nNational navies purchased Indiamen and converted them into troopships or warships.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The janissaries are professional soldiers, hardened by arduous training and given the best equipment in the army.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAs a force, they are the cream of the Ottoman army but, in comparison to some other nations, they fight in a slightly old fashioned way. This is small comfort to those who stand against them, as the janissaries are personally brave to the point of foolhardiness. They are also given to festooning themselves with weapons and hurling themselves into any fray!\n\nHistorically, the corps of janissaries (the term means “new soldiers”) dates back to the 14th Century. They were intended to replace the unreliable ghazi tribal warriors with a force indoctrinated to be completely loyal to the Sultan. This was achieved by taking boys as young as five for training and conversion to Islam if required. The janissaries had their own corps of engineers, supply troops and were even paid regularly, whether they were at war or not! Over time, however, they came to be used as bureaucrats and administrators, and this gave them too much power over the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the janissaries’ entrenched position in government became arrogance and an entrenched position against change, and so helped the Ottomans to stagnate and decline.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Light galleys have sails and oars, and light cannons mounted on platforms above the rowers’ benches.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIn restricted waters galleys are useful craft, although in any kind of heavy sea they can be dangerous to manage: it would be a brave or foolish captain who risked his galley in the North Sea or Atlantic. Although they do not carry as many guns as a modern sailing vessel, the ability to move independently of the wind is very useful.\n\nThe fighting crew of a galley is a relatively small part of the full crew, because the rowers are often convicts or pressed men and aboard only as strong backs, not as stout hearts. Indeed, in some navies the rowers are often more of a threat to the crew than the enemy! The number of men carried also limits the strategic range of a galley: they simply cannot carry enough food and water to sustain the crew for longer than a few days.\n\nHistorically, galleys did good service in sheltered waters like the Mediterranean and the Baltic, and the Ottomans, Russians and Swedes all used them in anger. They were also favoured by the Barbary Coast pirates, who could be guaranteed a good supply of slave rowers from captured European merchantmen.</long_description_text>

<key>lugger</key>
<description_text>Luggers are small vessels. Excellent for fishing and handy gunboats, pirates, smugglers and similar unsavoury, nautical fellows favour them!</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike many European ships, the ship’s rigging style gives the lugger its name. Lugsails are a development of the classic square-rig of larger vessels. The sails have yardarms, but the attachment of the yardarms to the mast is off-centre. As a result, the sails lie fore-and-aft, with the yards at a jaunty angle, rather than at right angles to the keel as in a square rigged vessel. This sail layout has much of the efficiency of a square rig when running before the wind, combined with the handiness of a fore-and-aft when changing course. In addition, sailing the ship only needs a small number of sailors, leaving more of the crew to do other work – or fight. \n\nIn military and quasi-military use, a lugger carries only a small complement of light guns, but these are usually sufficient to overpower or overawe a merchantman’s crew. A lugger is unlikely to survive for long against a properly handled armed naval vessel. However, the lugger’s speed and good handling qualities make it ideal for coastal scouting and a little light piracy! \n\nHistorically, the French “chasse-marée” is a type of lugger, originally a type of swift fishing boat. French privateers (pirates operating under a government licence) used these swift vessels to raid British commercial shipping.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Mamelukes are fearless light horsemen, deadly when deployed against a broken or unsupported enemy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nMounted on tireless light horses and armed with scimitars, they are commonly employed to harass an enemy force, restricting its space to manoeuvre easily. Once battle is fully joined, they will often time their charges to coincide with those of a supporting infantry unit, seeking to break the enemy quickly then wreaking havoc amongst them as they flee.\n\nMamelukes were traditionally slave soldiers of the various caliphs and sultans of the Middle Ages, captured as children and raised in the Islamic faith to provide their master with a force of men unconnected to any other part of the hierarchy. Over time, the Mamelukes accrued power of their own and even went as far as seizing control of Egypt; they founded a Mameluke Sultanate in 1250. Though the Mamelukes’ strength enabled the Sultanate to repel several invasions by Christian crusaders and Mongols, it was eventually overpowered by the Ottoman Empire in 1517. The Mamelukes so came into the service of the Sublime Porte.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nUnless these people do fight, and fight hard, they face little mercy at the hands of their former owners. Their tactics are those of partisan underdogs the world over: strike from an unexpected direction, retreat in the face of a prepared enemy, and show or expect no mercy.\n\nHistorically, the word “maroon” is taken from the Spanish term for a Moor, a man of (North) African origin. The various colonising powers tried, with mixed success, to eliminate the maroons; the British even went so far as to sign a treaty with the maroons on Jamaica that guaranteed them land, as long as they captured and returned any new runaways. To modern eyes, there is a massive amount of hypocrisy on both sides to be found in this arrangement.\n\nSome nations still have culturally-distinct Maroon populations, speaking their own creole languages (mixtures of existing languages to create something more than just a local dialect) and not having much contact with outsiders. Modern patterns of urbanisation are slowly dissolving these groups into the general population of each country.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Galleys are propelled by both oars and sails, with cannons on firing platforms above the rowers’ heads.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough made obsolescent by the rise of broadside-firing sailing ships, galleys still have a place in naval warfare. The wind (or its lack) does not limit their movement and, if well handled, galleys can run rings around sailing ships. A galley has a reasonable amount of firepower for its size with cannons on a firing platform, or with a full gun deck above the rowers (on a design called a galleas). Up to five men work each oar; these are convicts (at best) or slaves (at worst). The life of a rower is hard, brutal and can be short: chained to their oars, they will go down with the galley if it founders. \n\nThe galley’s main disadvantage is its vulnerability in heavy seas: it would almost certainly sink in a full Atlantic seaway. It is most useful in relatively calm waters such as the Mediterranean or Baltic. These smaller seas also help keep a galley close to port: the large crew size means that they cannot venture far from a supply port, making them unsuitable for trans-oceanic voyages. \n\nHistorically, the galley survived for a long time as a practical warship in sheltered waters. The Ottomans, Swedes and Russians all used them in their battle fleets. As late as the 1790s they were still in use in the Baltic and the Mediterranean (C. S. Forrester has his famous fictional hero Captain Horatio Hornblower face Spanish galleons in one encounter). North African corsairs also used galleys, as they had a ready supply of European slaves to serve in them.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThe flexibility of Mohawk Elite Warriors makes them invaluable on the battlefield, and they can pepper an enemy at a distance with arrows then engage in close combat to break any survivors. The Mohawks are merciless in warfare and practice the collection of scalps for trophies, meaning enemies can expect a literally hair-raising death! Anybody who manages to avoid a scalping might be tortured before being burned at the stake, or, if very lucky, adopted into the clan as a replacement for a dead Mohawk.\n\nHistorically, many Native American tribes used furs and skins to trade with the European settlers. High demand forced the Mohawks into intensive hunting that soon depleted the beaver population in their area, leaving them with little to trade. In 1630 the Mohawks started the ‘Beaver Wars’, attacking other tribes and seizing control of the lucrative fur trade. Because of their loyalty to the British, the Mohawks concentrated their attacks on the tribes trading with the French, hurting their enemies and making a profit in the process.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nMuscogee bowmen are deadly shots, capable of shooting the shiny buttons off a European soldier at one hundred paces! Their warrior spirit encourages competition, and this healthy competition encourages the warrior spirit. Trained from an early age, these men use their bows to feed their families and for protection. They are specialists in skirmish warfare, and provide assistance to the main force of the tribe, protecting against enemy skirmish attacks and harassing the foe where possible.\n\nHistorically, the Muscogee and Cherokee relationship with the European powers was a rocky one. During the French and Indian War they sided with the British, but this alliance was far from settled. As the war progressed, the conduct of British soldiers angered the Cherokee; renegade troops committed terrible crimes against Cherokee women and children when the warriors were away. This eventually prompted the Cherokee and their allies to attack the British, and their war continued until peace was declared between France and Britain in 1763. The Cherokee eventually made peace in November of that year.</long_description_text>

In the time it takes to fire and reload a musket, a good bowman can fire half a dozen aimed shots, and probably have moved to better ground while doing so.\n\nIn the early days of their contact with the various foreign powers that colonized America, the tribes were glad to co-operate with them, and formed alliances with the French, British and Dutch. The tribes soon became involved in trade, and often ended up fighting proxy wars on behalf of their allies.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Native Artillery gives the firepower needed to put formal, set-piece battles against Europeans on an equal footing. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nArtillery gives any war chief an awesome amount of power to strike down his enemies. It does, however, require careful handling in battle to make artillery work well with the informal tactics that many tribes use.\n\nThe art of making and repairing cannons is one that tribal smiths can understand, but it is not an easy process with their tools and resources.\n\nHistorically, the Native Americans never developed anything approaching an artillery corps. Heavy weapons did not suit their style of fighting and would have reduced the tribes’ strategic mobility too. The Europeans were also quite careful to prevent the tribes acquiring any cannons: the military independence that this would have granted was a step too far.</long_description_text>

They provide military leadership and war chiefs are chosen from their ranks to keep discipline, organise hunting parties and oversee ceremonies. \n\nWarrior societies quickly gained a reputation for unrelenting ferociousness. They would literally tether themselves to one spot on a battlefield, and not move until the battle was over. They would battle against any enemy that came at them and never even consider retreat. They were skilled with a number of weapons including the tomahawk and the war club.</long_description_text>

This is their contribution to the safety and strength of all involved in a battle.\n\nHistorically, medicine men and shamans gave supposedly magical power to those in their tribes, but they also gave practical medical help too.

<long_description_text>\n\nThe horsemanship of many Native Americans is unparalleled. Able to wield any number of weapons on horseback, they are formidable foes. Perhaps their most deadly weapon from horseback is the lance. Often decorated with items to commemorate courageous acts performed by a warrior, eagle feathers traditionally mark a particularly ferocious man. \n\nThe traditional lance used for hunting was found to be far too long for use in warfare, and a much shorter version was developed. The materials used to make a lance would depend on the areas a tribe inhabited, but the “business end” was made from flint, a material far sharper than many more “civilized” materials.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nA musket is a status symbol among the tribes, even though it is not as useful in a fight as an old-fashioned and reliable bow. It is, however, a mark of personal bravery that a warrior has taken one in battle, or been considered worthy enough to have been given one of the precious weapons. These men are the most irregular of forces, unwilling to take formal army discipline, yet willing to fight like men possessed when the need arises.\n\nIn the early days of European settlement, the Native Americans were happy to work with the various foreign powers that colonized America, even forming alliances against their neighbours and other Europeans. The tribes soon became involved in trade, fought wars because of the allegiances they forged, and were forced into new alliances as old tribal enemies took up with Europeans.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nA musket is a status symbol among the tribes, even though it is not as practical or reliable as a hunting bow. A musket does, however, have a greater killing power and range than a bow. Warrior tactics in battle closely resemble those of European skirmishers, moving as small groups and firing as individuals. Massed volleys are almost unknown.\n\nHistorically, the tribes used whatever smoothbore muskets they could obtain by trade, theft or conquest. It was highly unlikely that any two guns would bear more than a passing similarity, unless the tribe had managed to ambush and defeat a European military unit.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Tribesmen are a melee unit, relying primarily on force of numbers over skill.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWhen the tribe is threatened all men are called to arms. Young or old matters little as long as they have the strength and will to hold a weapon. Some men may have never seen battle, and only have weapons used in the hunt. Pride in protecting the tribe and the possible spoils that come from distinguishing oneself in battle are enough to drive tribesmen forward.\n\nHistorically, tattoos commemorated the brave actions of a tribesman. Fish bones or rock splinters were used to cut the design, and soot or natural dyes coloured the wound. If one tribe defeated another in battle all those on the winning side were given tattoos to commemorate the victory. Animal totems were another popular theme, giving the wearer the strength of the creature in the tattoo design.</long_description_text>

A chance to distinguish oneself on the battlefield is a way to gain status in the eyes of the tribe, and if this means fighting for Europeans in their wars, then so be it. The Europeans value their native fighters for their skilled field craft and bravery. There are also the spoils of war to consider.\n\nMany Native Americans were employed as scouts and fighters along the frontier. From a European perspective, it made sense to keep potentially dangerous men under close supervision, and to use their aggression against enemies rather than having it turned against the colonists.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nWarriors dominate Native American society. They defend the tribes and earn renown while doing so. This gives them the status to become unchallenged chiefs and leaders in all aspects of tribal life. Hunting is also a fine preparation for war, as it teaches a man to be unafraid of bloodshed and danger.\n\nHistorically, the tribes used a wide variety of weapons for the hunt and warfare. Some were the same for both but others, like the war club, were of little use except when hunting other men. Traditionally carved from a single piece of hard wood, as the influence of Europeans grew, the war club came to imitate the shape of a rifle butt.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nNo true warrior willingly runs from a fight. A man’s worth in tribal society is often measured by his skill as a warrior and war leader. Fighting for the Europeans gives a man many chances to go into battle, earn honour and gain in skill and reputation. The chance to fight traditional tribal enemies is also welcome.\n\nHistorically, European settlers had few qualms about exploiting the warlike nature of some native peoples of the New World. It was far better to have a “noble savage” at your side than facing you in battle.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nAs a result, these men are horse archers almost without peer, well able to use any ground to full effect. Even superior firepower may be of little use against them, as they have the speed to attack and then pull back out of range before it can be brought to bear.\n\nRaiding has always been an important, even natural, part of the Navajo economy. This made many enemies for the Navajo among other tribes as well as European settlers.\n\nAfter many years of Navajo raids, counter-raids and treaties, the United States government demanded the surrender of the Navajo. It was the adoption of a scorched-earth policy that starved the Navaho out of their homelands. In January 1864, many Navajos started what became known as the Long Walk, a journey to Fort Sumner. The overcrowded reservation contained ten thousand people inhabiting an area meant for five thousand. Four hundred of those were Mescalero Apaches, rivals of the Navajo. The Navajos were eventually allowed to return home, in 1868, finally completing their Long Walk.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThese troops are equipped as line infantry, and carry smoothbore muskets. Their uniforms are splendid, and mark them out as a superior unit, in arrogance if nothing else. They are trained to deliver devastating volley fire, and never to waver in the face of a foe. This attitude serves them well in battle, as the Guard can hardly be seen to cut and run, no matter how hot the fight.\n\nHistorically, the guards sometimes became the only unit a leader could rely on when politics got out of hand, most of the time. It was not unknown for the Guard to be kingmakers, even in a republic, and only give their protection to their preferred choice of leader. With the turbulent history of the Dutch, the Holland Guard were provided with numerous opportunities to change the national leader. As the 18th century drew to a close, the fire of the French Revolution was spreading through Europe: free thinkers saw the merits of the Revolution and many set their minds on something similar in their own countries.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These troops of the “new model” army are armed, equipped and trained in the latest Western European military fashion. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFighting in formal order with tight control and disciplined fire is a new idea for Turkish forces; the traditional method has usually involved heavily armed and very brave men hurling themselves pell-mell at the enemy. The Nizam-I Cedit fight just as bravely, but with much more organisation. This “new model” army is such a break with the past that it has even adopted Western-style military dress for the most part.\n\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit reforms were made vital by the repeatedly poor performance of the Ottoman armies against the Russians. The Empire’s inability to defend itself against a growing Slavic threat, and European predatory moves, was the reason why Turkey became the “sick man of Europe”. The French Revolutionary Republic (anxious for any allies at the time) provided much of the starting expertise that the Ottomans required for retraining their army in modern tactics and methods. The process was not without problems, though. The janissaries resented their loss of privileges and position and eventually the corps had to be disbanded.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThough they fight on foot, the skis with which these men are equipped allow them a greater range of operation in winter than ordinary troops. Their knowledge of their snowbound environment is a valuable asset which can be used to great advantage.\n\nThe mountainous terrain of Scandinavia, shrouded in wintry conditions for much of each year, serves to severely restrict the mobility of conventional troops. The local populace have adapted to these challenges in a number of ways, perhaps the most significant of which is their use of skis. With skis, a man can travel for many miles in the time, while a walking man would exhaust himself blundering a few hundred yards through the snow.\n\nLightly-equipped mountain or winter specialists give a commander many more options about where to attack in this kind of terrain. Ski troopers excel at a hit-and-run style of warfare, ideal for harassing and isolating an enemy. Able to travel surprising distances in a short space of time, they will attack an enemy from an unexpected quarter, fading away before an effective pursuit can be organised.</long_description_text>

Wielding bows and tomahawks, the Ojibwa bombard foes with an assault that is both swift and terrible. They are an excellent force to counter skirmishers.\n\nHistorically, the Ojibwa were friendly with the French and fought alongside them against the British during the French-Indian Wars. Unfortunately, the Ojibwa had to deal with the British victors when the war was over. Rather than learning from the good relationships the French had built up, the British discouraged any camaraderie and ceased the annual tradition of gifts to the tribes. This provoked Pontiac’s Rebellion, an uprising consisting of many tribes, including the Ojibwa, under the Ottawa leader Pontiac.</long_description_text>

<description_text>For some navies big is never quite big enough! This oversized “first rate ship of the line” is more a floating fortress than a mere battleship.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis 120-gun (or larger) “first rate” is larger than a normal ship of that class, and far more powerful than a simple count of guns would imply. The ship carries 32-, 24- and 18-pounders on its decks, and wherever possible heavier guns replace the standard cannon found on a normal first rate. The result is a very expensive, very powerful, very prestigious warship, but one that can have limited utility. Few nations can afford the expense of building and crewing such a vessel, or can operate it far from shore facilities for very long. Its sailing qualities might be charitably described as “lubberly”: this is not a ship for chasing down enemies. All these drawbacks are secondary to its massive firepower and intimidating presence: this is a ship for dashing enemies to very small pieces!\n\nHistorically, only the Santísima Trinidad, a Spanish “super battleship” of four decks and some 136 guns, ever fought in action. Constructed as a three-decker she was enormous at 120 guns, even before her reworking. She fought at Cape St Vincent (1797) and Trafalgar (1805), and foundered after the latter battle in a storm while being towed away as a prize. The American USS Pennsylvania (ordered 1821; completed 1837) never saw action, and the US Navy destroyed her in 1860 to keep her out of Confederate hands.</long_description_text>

Their tomahawks can be used in close combat or flung from afar, but the effect on an enemy’s skull will remain constant and terrible! If a warrior defeats an enemy’s courage the battle is already half won: only the messy business of hacking at the flesh remains undone.\n\nThe Petun were part of the Huron Confederacy and lived in what is now Southern Ontario. The Petun’s name comes from the tobacco plant that they cultivated, smoked and traded. Tobacco was commonly used by the Native Americans, as they believed it to be a gift from the Creator. Due to its sacred origins, tobacco was used in offerings to the spirits, charms and incantations. It was also used for medicinal purposes and smoked to mark important social occasions, deals or decisions.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These hardy sons of the frontier have taken up arms to defend their homes and loved ones.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAlthough not trained soldiers, pioneers can turn their natural advantages of self-reliance and mutual help to advantage in times of war. Although they are an armed rabble at first sight, they have marksmanship skills honed by the need to put food in their children’s bellies. Their muskets might have seen use in bringing down quail or deer, but they are still capable of killing men. In hand-to-hand combat against the native tribes they have the disadvantages of all so-called civilized men, but with some native cunning as a result of living alongside the natives for so many years.\n\nThe colonial frontier required men to be self-reliant in all things, including defence. A man who could not take up arms to defend his homestead and family would soon find himself without both. Self-defence, however, was often extended to become a form of pre-emptive self-defence, as the colonial settlers banded together and, for want of a better term, went on the warpath against their tribal neighbours. Their logic was impeccable in its own terms, entirely driven by fear that the tribes would attack them if they did not attack first.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These irregular cavalry are a rabble, not a military force, but they are hardy, brutal individuals, well able to fight for hearth and home.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are armed with carbines, and dead-eye shots, well used to using firearms to feed their kinfolk. They are equally adept at hunting men, both criminals and enemies. They can fight from horseback, or dismount and fight just as well as an ill-trained but courageous dragoon militia force. The ability to cover terrain quickly and then fight as best suits the ground makes them a relatively formidable threat.\n\nThe pioneers were almost forced to fight as dragoons of a sort rather than a proper cavalry force because of their available horses. Cavalry horses are expensive, highly trained and rare beasts on the frontier. A pioneer can, in moments of need, throw a blanket and saddle on his plough horse and ride it into battle. Of course, the loss of a horse is greater than just the loss of a transport. It can also mean starvation for a family as land goes unploughed or crops rot in the fields because they cannot be harvested.</long_description_text>

<key>puckle_gun</key>
<description_text>The Puckle gun is a tripod-mounted repeating heavy musket or small cannon, capable of rapid fire.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nIt achieves this by using pre-loaded breech chambers that are rotated into line with the barrel, fired and then a new chamber is positioned for the next shot. All this is achieved mechanically, by the operator revolving a handle at the back of the piece. As long as loaded magazines are available for the piece, a puckle gun can be kept in rapid fire action!\n\nHistorically, James Puckle’s “defence gun” was not a huge success, partly because the engineering of 1718 simply wasn&apos;t up to the task of producing components with fine tolerances. His gun had promise, though, as it could fire shots around three times faster than a well-trained fusilier. One odd feature of the design was the two versions offered to potential customers: a round barrel fired conventional bullets for shooting at Christian (but not Protestant) enemies, while a second barrel was offered that fired square bullets (that allegedly did more damage) for use against Turks and similar unwelcome infidels. The British Royal Navy never bought any, and other users were equally reluctant to part with their money. Puckle’s career as a gunsmith ended in failure for him and his investors.</long_description_text>

<key>razee</key>
<description_text>A razee is a robust frigate, created by cutting the top deck off a larger ship of the line. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nFrigates are a vital part of any balanced sea-going fleet. They are cruisers that can operate independently and are swift enough to hunt down enemy merchantmen. The chance for prize money makes them popular postings among officers and men alike! \n\nOne way of creating a large, powerful frigate is to take a two-deck ship of the line and, in effect, saw off the top deck creating a single-deck frigate. The first result is that a 64-gun ship can now only carry 44 guns, but the ones that remain are the heavier than those normally found on a frigate, typically 32- or 24-pounders rather than the expected 18s! The second result is that the razee retains the strong timbers of the original 64, making it a robust ship in combat. Thirdly, having lost its upper works, the new ship generally handles rather well under sail. All this work takes time and valuable dock space, of course. \n\nHistorically, one of the most successful razees was HMS Indefatigable, commanded by Edward Pellew. In the company of another frigate, Pellew took on - and defeated - the Droits de l&apos;Homme, a French 74, in 1797. During the next year or so, Pellew and the Indefatigable went on to take a further nine vessels.</long_description_text>

<description_text>Revolutionary forces are passionate men, drawn to the colours to show their bravery in support of their national revolution and its glorious aims. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nSkill-at-arms is sometimes of secondary importance to such men, as is traditional military discipline. Officers are almost certainly supporters of the old regime, and should thus be banished from military service, lest they commit treachery or worse. As far as drill and tactics are concerned, fervour and loyalty to the cause are excellent substitutes. Training for battle therefore becomes little more than the ability to march forward, into any kind of hell. The revolution is a noble cause, and the worthiness of it will surely carry the men to victory after victory, no matter what the odds they face. Those who shirk in their duty of victory are disloyal!\n\nHistorically, getting rid of the officer corps in France after the Revolution was probably inevitable, but not necessarily wise. The Bourbon French army had been officered almost exclusively by noblemen and, with nobles being executed on an hourly basis, their loyalty to the new regime was doubtful. However, they did have the tactical expertise, and regaining that was to cost many lives.</long_description_text>

<description_text>The Riskers of Souls are madmen armed with nothing but scimitars; their lack of fear makes them truly dangerous.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese men are chosen for one simple reason: they are all raving lunatics! Touched by God, they fear nothing, and will recklessly hurl themselves at any enemy until they are dead or there is nothing left to attack. Their wild-eyed appearance is enough to make even the bravest man draw back.\n\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire is seen as a cruel state, willing to kidnap and use children in its military forces if necessary. The recruitment of madmen, then, is unusual to modern eyes, but not out of character. However, the word “lunatic” for the unfortunates in this unit may be a misunderstanding. The word “deli” has been translated as “mad”, but it may have been mad in the sense that the British army also use the term as an affectionate epithet, meaning ready for a fight, brave, “up for it” and heroic.</long_description_text>

<key>rocket_ship</key>
<description_text>A rocket ship is a floating arsenal, usually converted from a two-masted ketch-rigged vessel. The whole ship is given over to a rocket battery and the necessary stores.</description_text>
<long_description_text> \n\nA rocket ship is intended to plaster a large area with a huge number of rocket projectiles in a very short time. The need for a large deck space to be clear for the rockets’ launch troughs compromises the ship’s handling and sailing qualities, but this is a small price to pay for horrendous and terrifying firepower! There is also the danger to the crew: the risk of explosion is enough to age any captain prematurely, and rigging chains (not ropes) and wetted sails are standard features.\n\nMilitary rockets are the result of European troops getting some very nasty surprises when campaigning in India (Congreve’s rocket system was designed to copy Indian weapons). The large variety of warheads, including explosive shells, makes rockets a versatile but often inaccurate weapon. The best way of using rockets is en masse: the more fired at a single target, the better, given that some are almost inevitably going to fly astray – not that this inaccuracy matters to those on the receiving end!\n\nHistorically, the Royal Navy used rockets to bombard ports and enemy fortifications. The phrase “the rockets’ red glare” in the US national anthem commemorates the use of Congreve rockets against Fort McHenry, which guarded the harbour entrance at Baltimore, Maryland, during the War of 1812.</long_description_text>

<description_text>War rockets are a terrifying device, capable of carrying different kinds of warhead and of causing utter panic in their targets.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese iron tubes filled with gunpowder propellant are fired in large volleys; the noise alone could be somewhat unnerving. Each rocket is laid in an angled launcher, and it is the job of the artilleryman to correctly judge the angle of launch to drop the rockets in the middle of the enemy. He also needs to take into account wind, as the long tails of the rockets can mean they are blown off course. The least dangerous rockets are tipped with a large spear point, but explosive heads are also fitted.\n\nHistorically, it was the Indian war rockets used by Tippu Sultan of Mysore that introduced Europeans to the concept. The experience was not a pleasant one. The British copied these weapons as the Congreve rocket system, and used them aboard ships as well as on land. A rocket troop was present at the final defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, although accounts of their effectiveness vary. Congreve’s system even included illumination rounds to light up the battlefield!</long_description_text>

<description_text>Sikhs are an independently-minded people, fiercely brave, and extremely adept in battle.  </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nSikhs are a distinctive community from northern India; they are easily recognised by their turbans, beards and uncut hair. They also carry swords as one of the marks of their faith, and sometimes for less ceremonial purposes. In addition to being a devout people, Sikhs have a proud martial tradition, like many in the Punjab. As fighters, they are fierce foes, and rightly feared by their neighbours and enemies.\n\nHistorically, Sikhism is the youngest of the world’s major religions. The word “sikh” can be translated as disciple or pupil. Arising in 15th Century Mughal India, the leaders of the new faith were often persecuted by the Mughals, although sometimes for political rather than religious reasons. With the decline in Mughal power, the Sikhs managed to carve out a kingdom of their own, and gave the advancing British several nasty shocks. It is noticeable that the British Raj later made very extensive use of Sikh troops. Even today, when Sikhs are only a tiny percentage of India’s population, they represent a substantial part of the Indian Army’s officer corps.</long_description_text>

<description_text>A sloop of war is usually ketch-rigged with two masts. These small vessels handle well in restricted waters. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThe ability to navigate in exceptionally shallow or dangerous waters makes sloops very useful in such seas as the reef-strewn waters of the Caribbean. They can also operate without the need for extensive onshore naval facilities nearby. They are also extremely useful as fleet auxiliaries, carrying out communications tasks and vital inshore scouting work, and can hunt down smaller prey such as privateers and small enemy cargo vessels. A sloop-of-war (sometimes a corvette in French service) is a different vessel from a civilian, merchant sloop, having a flush deck, two square-rigged masts, guns, and a larger crew.\n\nHistorically, a post captain would rarely command a ship this small. The commanding officer was the “master and commander” (this is the origin of the modern naval rank of commander), and held the formal rank of lieutenant. Captain Cook RN commanded HMS Resolution, a sloop converted from a collier (coal ship), on his epic Pacific voyages and was highly satisfied with its performance. Sloop captains could be aggressive: before his promotion to post captain, Thomas Cochrane commanded the 14-gun HMS Speedy and managed to capture “El Gamo”, a Spanish xebec of 32 guns with a crew six times larger than his own!</long_description_text>

<description_text>The USS Constitution is a powerful, heavy frigate in the United States Navy.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nShe is easily the equal of many smaller fourth rate ships of the line in terms of combat power as she carries 44 24-pounder guns; a normal frigate in another navy would carry 12-pounders at best. The Constitution is also strongly built and large, allowing her to withstand punishment from other frigates and still be able to outrun larger opposition.\n\nUnlikely as it sounds, the United States sold off the ships of the Continental Navy after the Revolutionary War. This had unfortunate consequences because the Barbary pirates noticed that, if America was a new nation, American ships were no longer protected by any treaty signed with Britain. The USS Constitution was therefore intended to combat the pirates. Even more incredibly, once a treaty with the pirates had been signed, construction was suspended! Eventually, Congress agreed to fund the ship, and she was launched in 1797.\n\nIn 1801 the Constitution was used as a flagship during the First Barbary War, but her most famous action was in fighting the Royal Navy’s HMS Guerriere (captured from the French in 1806) during the War of 1812. During the vicious close-in battle, British shot bounced off the thick planking of the Constitution, giving rise to her nickname “Old Ironsides”.</long_description_text>

<description_text>HMS Victory is a first rate ship of the line, carrying some 100 guns and a crew of more than 800 men.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nLike all first rates, Victory is not a handy ship, being both slow and unresponsive. Good sailing qualities, however, are secondary to the weight of broadside that she can both deliver and withstand. This is important in a warship that is intended to form the centrepiece of any squadron and act as an admiral’s flagship.\n\nCompleted in 1765, Victory is probably the most famous first rate in history, and the only one still in existence. The work of naval architect and genius Sir Thomas Slade, Victory was always intended to be a flagship; the Royal Navy preferred the smaller 74s as battleships. Forty years later, in 1805, she was Horatio Nelson’s flagship at Trafalgar, a battle which gave the Royal Navy undisputed mastery of the world’s oceans for more than a century.\n\nAs of 2008, the ship is still the flagship to “CINCNAVHOME”, a rather unromantic NATO-speak acronym for the Royal Navy’s Second Sea Lord. The ship is in dry dock in southern England as part of the Portsmouth Dockyards museum. Modern RN warships still salute the Victory as they enter and leave harbour.</long_description_text>

<key>sp_ed_organ_gun</key>
<description_text>Thanks to its multiple barrels, an organ gun can fire devastating volleys all on its own. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAn organ gun has several barrels that are fired, almost simultaneously, when the gunner applies the match. In theory, each barrel could be loaded with a different kind of projectile, although given the different ranges of, say, shot and canister, this would be wasteful. Only a suicidal or slightly mad artilleryman would use explosive shells. There is a good chance that the first shell would have exploded in its barrel before the last is prepared.\n\nThere has always been a tendency to make artillery pieces with more than one barrel. The great Leonardo da Vinci was among many to design a ribauldequin, or volley gun. As so often with artillery, the Ottoman Turks were ahead of European gunmakers in their work. They also persisted with producing organ guns after other nations had abandoned them. They also experimented with cannons of differing calibres, where a central barrel would be surrounded by small bore tubes cast into the main cannon wall. The French also flirted with a design for a triple-barrelled cannon early in the 18th Century, but it was heavy and offered no real advantages over three ordinary guns of the same calibre.</long_description_text>

<key>steam_ship</key>
<description_text>A steamship still uses sails, but the ability to ignore the wind is highly desirable in a warship. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nBy fitting a steam engine and all its machinery into an existing hull, naval architects hoped to create a ship-of-the-line not tied to the wind and tide. In this, they were moderately successful. A steamship can sail independently of the prevailing winds, but most still spend a good deal of time under sail. Coal is expensive, and coaling stations are few and far between; steam is not a practical method of strategic movement.\n\nTactically, however, it is a different story. With powerful guns, a steamship can out-manoeuvre any sailing ship. Admittedly, the idea of going into battle with a fire raging in the belly of his ship is not one that appeals to every captain. Boiler explosions are not entirely unknown either, as safety features are installed as the fancy takes the engineer, not as a matter of course. A stray shot through the engine room can also do terrible damage.\n\nHistorically, The conversion of ships of the line to steam was never going to be anything more than a stopgap measure. Steamships, with their dirt and smoke, were not popular with traditionally minded captains, particularly in the British Royal Navy. They expected obsessively high standards of neatness and cleanliness, with no soot and lubricating oil smeared over their nice clean ships.</long_description_text>

<description_text>These light cavalrymen are superb horsemen, expert in skirmishing and harassing an enemy. </description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThere is a long tradition on the steppes of fighting from horseback. Children are put in the saddle before they can walk, and this makes them almost part of the horse. In previous centuries, accurately firing a bow while riding at speed requires a man who has exceptional ability with both the weapon and a horse. Steppe warriors can control their horses using their knees, and without the need to hold the reins they can use weapons easily and well. Their tactics have always involved galloping up to a slower enemy, delivering a devastating volley, and then riding away again. This way of warfare has survived in the era of pistols and muskets, although most steppe warriors carry numerous weapons (if they can) to avoid reloading in the heat of battle.\n\nHistorically, all the eastern nations had an ambiguous relationship with the steppe peoples. They both feared them and wanted their services. This allowed the more cunning steppe tribes to keep a measure of autonomy when other “natives” were being ruthlessly crushed.</long_description_text>

As they near a battle the Ojibwa make their final preparations for war: strong medicine is prepared and war paint applied. These are not men to quail in the face of an enemy.\n\nIn May 1830 the Indian Removal Act was passed by the US Congress. This allowed the United States government to move tribes from east of the Mississippi to the west. Though the process was supposedly voluntary, the system was used “creatively”. In 1850, the Ojibwa were forced to move when their annual payments and supplies were sent east, away from their spiritual home. Only a small percentage of the payment and supplies arrived, and as a result over three hundred Ojibwa died from disease and starvation. Public outcry eventually led to the Act’s repeal and the establishment of Native Reservations.</long_description_text>

<long_description_text>\n\nThe Winnebago are not the most forgiving of tribes, and do not forget a transgression easily. On the battlefield, they are fearsome fighters in a melee whenever they are allowed to close with enemies. The thrill of battle is their strength and joy.\n\nAway from the battlefield, many an envoy has met the wrong end of a tomahawk or ended up in a Winnebago’s belly after mistakenly thinking they could be bargained with or bought.\n\nBy 1665, a series of misfortunes caused the Winnebago’s numbers to dwindle to five hundred: there was a disastrous storm, and an epidemic decimated the tribe. The remainder starved as they were too weak from disease to harvest their crops. Seeing the Winnebago so depleted, their former Illinois enemies sent them food and warriors as an act of goodwill. The newcomers were welcomed, and then killed during a celebration feast. The vengeful Illinois waited until they had an opportunity to attack, during the Winnebagos’ winter hunt and almost wiped them out. Only at the end of the Beaver Wars was the tribe restored by intermarriage with Algonquin refugees.</long_description_text>

<key>haydut_irregulars</key>
<description_text>These irregulars have the field skills needed to survive in the mountains, and all the cunning of bandits.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThis is because they are bandits. They carry muskets, and have the skills to use them extremely accurately compared to other musket-armed troops. Haydut irregulars are extremely good at using ground cover, and can hide in almost any terrain, again as might be expected of brigands or bandits. They are, however, not suited to combat against cavalrymen, as they have no formal military training. They do not wear armour, as this would slow them down if they needed to run away!\n\nIn the Balkans a haydut (the Turkish version of the word) or hajduk, was a Muslim or Christian bandit, but one who stole mostly from the Ottoman overlords, led his fellows in fighting injustice, and robbed the rich to give to the poor. All this is very romantic, but not entirely inaccurate. The hayduts were bandits, but they did not always fight against the Ottomans. For the right money, they could also be persuaded to fight for the Sultan. Like bandits everywhere, their equipment and uniforms were taken from their victims, so it was not uncommon to see hayduts using Austrian as well as Turkish war gear.</long_description_text>

<key>wallachian_boyars</key>
<description_text>These swift light horsemen are right to see themselves as better men than their foes, as they pursue enemies from the battlefield.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nWallachian boyars carry sabres but do not wear armour. This aids them in moving quickly across broken ground but makes them vulnerable when in combat against heavy cavalrymen. It would be wasteful to use boyars attacking formed infantry in square, but they are extremely useful in pursuing already-broken enemies. They can also be used to ride down disorganised troops and skirmishers.\n\nWallachia had been a battleground for over a century, as both the Austrians and the Russians attempted to take the province from the Ottomans during a series of wars. The boyar aristocracy were not, however, always impressed with their new rulers and their absolutist ways: they had often enjoyed more latitude under the Ottomans. Being a boyar was a mark of nobility, and meant that a boyar man owned land, had serfs, and had military duties or obligations. The boyars had begun as elected chiefs but had, over the centuries, become a hereditary class; this meant a man could be “of boyar bones” and aristocratic even if he lacked lands or serfs to work it. As in many other parts of Europe, military service was an honourable, possibly the only, profession for a nobleman.</long_description_text>

<key>bosnian_panduks</key>
<description_text>These irregulars are expert skirmishers, but can also give foes a nasty shock in close combat.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are armed with muskets and swords, and use both with equal skill and ruthlessness, as might be expected of men who are expected to use brigandage as a stratagem. They do not wear armour, as this would slow them down when moving across country, but they are able to use the same broken country to good effect when going to ground and hiding. If they are vulnerable in combat, it is when facing cavalry, as they lack the formal training to use square formation against mounted men.\n\nPanduks are, in many ways, the Ottoman equivalent of Austrian pandours. Indeed, men might find themselves serving both sides during their lives. Pandours were irregulars, employed to act as brigands in attacking enemy lines of supply. The Bosnian Panduks performed much the same duties, and were recruited from among ex-soldiers of many armies. It was quite possible to find men in their ranks that had once worn Austrian, Russian, and Ottoman uniforms. What united them was their Bosnian nationality: unlike other conquests in the Balkans, the Ottomans left the territorial extent of Bosnia unchanged. They wiped out the aristocracy, but left the people&apos;s sense of identity and place untouched.</long_description_text>

<key>circassian_armoured_cavalry</key>
<description_text>Medieval cavalry in chainmail may look hopelessly old fashioned, but it is a foolish enemy who underestimates these men.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThese cavalrymen may look like they have ridden out of a storybook, or be fighting Crusader knights, but they are superb horsemen and can deliver a shocking charge against an unwary enemy. If this does not break a foe’s line, they can then fight in melee with their sabres until they do win! Armour and weight, however, do not help much when facing the cannons’ blast or when trying to break into a well-formed infantry square.\n\nThe people of the Caucasus Mountains have a long tradition of producing beautiful women and brave and skilled fighters. Circassian ladies were highly regarded for their looks, intelligence, and spirit, and were considered very desirable concubines by the Ottomans. Circassian men had centuries of experience of fighting invaders and each other. They were also extremely set in their ways: they produced fine and beautiful weapons and armour in, as might be expected, somewhat conservative and traditionalist designs. Armoured cavalrymen from the Caucasus were in Russian service as well as in the Ottoman army, and were rightly regarded as an asset, not an archaic burden.</long_description_text>

<key>armenian_archers</key>
<description_text>Seemingly archaic in an age of gunpowder and revolutionary fervour, these bow-armed skirmishers are still a dangerous force.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are capable of covering ground quickly, and of using the land and cover to best advantage: hiding behind a blade of grass or a pebble if needs must! While their bows might seem outmoded, their skills give them a good rate of fire and are accurate: an enemy killed by an arrow is as dead as one shot by a musket ball. Armenian archers carry knives to be used in hand-to-hand combat, but they should not be committed to melee without good reason. They are also vulnerable to cavalry attack, and can suffer excessive casualties when facing riflemen or specialist musketeers.\n\nHistorically, Ottoman subjects could, and did, declare that they were soldiers by arming themselves and joining an army in the field. They could leave the service without penalty just as easily. What looked like lack of organisation was useful: good leaders attracted followers and kept them. However, provincial troops were not always as loyal to the Sultan in Istanbul as they were to their locality or commander, and there was a regrettable tendency for private, rather than state, armies to flourish.</long_description_text>

<key>libyan_kuloglu</key>
<description_text>Libyan kuloglu are auxiliary cavalry, capable of dismounting to deliver a devastating volley with their blunderbusses.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey also carry sabres, which can be used when in the saddle, giving the ability to fight well in melee. Unlike some other Turkish and Ottoman troops, they do not wear armour. Their blunderbusses are large-bore flintlock weapons, much like giant shotguns, and cannot be used from horseback. They have a very short range but a blast from one, let alone a volley from a whole unit, is terrible. This weapon makes the kuloglu a superb attacking force, if they can get within range of the target. They suffer when facing troops with longer-ranged muskets or rifles.\n\nHistorically, the kuloglu were recruited from the sons of ethnic Turkish janissaries and local, Libyan women. These men were specifically excluded from joining the ranks of the prestigious janissaries, proving their worth by fighting with bravery and discipline - particularly during the American attack on Tripoli. Indeed, kuloglu who behaved in a cowardly way were made to dress as women until they redeemed themselves through acts of not-quite-suicidal bravery, or died in the attempt. This, however, was mild compared to what was done to any who “abused” young prisoners taken in battle: the offender was beheaded or beaten 1000 times with a stout cane, something that was surely a protracted death sentence!</long_description_text>

<description_text>These musket-armed regulars are good soldiers and, as garrison troops, are well able to keep order among the ordinary folk.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nPalestinian auxiliaries would seem to be an oxymoron: high quality militia. In fact, they are extremely useful soldiers, perfectly capable of fighting  by delivering volley fire and in melee also. They are, however, outmatched by regular infantry with better training and equipment, and are vulnerable to cavalry attacks as they lack the discipline to form defensive squares. However, their policing abilities more than make up for any battlefield shortcomings.\n\nPalestine is an ancient land, although it has rarely enjoyed independence from outside control. After the Ottoman conquest of Palestine in 1516 the name disappeared from maps, and the area was referred to as the vilayet, or province, of Sayda, now Sidon in modern Lebanon. The idea of a Palestinian people, however, persisted. The Palestinians were loyal to the idea of the Ottoman Empire, and fought hard in its defence. Under Jezzar Pasha, Palestinians were among those who stubbornly held out at the Siege of Acre in 1799, forcing Napoleon Bonaparte and his French army to withdraw. This helped to bring his schemes of conquest in the Middle East to a halt.</long_description_text>

<key>cairo_janissaries</key>
<description_text>Cairo janissaries are recruited from among the children of janissary families, which gives them a sense of camaraderie and superiority.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are armed with muskets and swords, making them equally useful in the firing line or in melee. They are, however, vulnerable to cavalry as their training does not include formal drills to form square for protection. They do not wear armour, despite appearing rather old-fashioned compared to European troops.\n\nJanissaries were always an elite group within the Ottoman military, although by the end of the eighteenth century they were no longer necessarily numbered among the best soldiers in the world. Originally, janissaries had been recruited from among Christian boy children within Ottoman lands, as troops under the direct control of the Sultan and as a counter to his more powerful vassals. The practice of taking children in this way was gradually abandoned, and by the 18th Century the janissaries were a power in their own right. The Cairo janissaries were almost exclusively recruited from among Arabic Egyptians. Turkish members of the larger corps did their best to make sure that the janissaries, and their own families, gained and kept control of the plum jobs within the Ottoman administration. As a result, they ceased to be a purely military force and became a highly conservative group, determined to fight any reform within the Empire that reduced their influence.</long_description_text>

<key>mounted_nizam-i-cedit</key>
<description_text>These mounted infantry ride into battle before delivering volleys of fire, but can fight on horseback if needed.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey are armed with muskets, which are used dismounted in the manner of European-style dragoons, and fight with sabres when they attack while mounted. In either role, they are not quite as effective or efficient as properly specialised soldiers, but the flexibility that they give a commander in their use more than makes up for this lack. They should not be used as shock cavalry, but can prove useful as pursuit forces, or for riding down disorganised opposition.\n\nHistorically, the Nizam-I Cedit were a “new model” army that used western European military doctrine and practices. The janissary corps vigorously opposed these foreign ideas, because they diminished warriors by expecting them to fight as parts in a machine rather than show individual bravery. This was not the right way to conduct wars, or for righteous men to act. The rest of the Ottoman army rather resented the Nizam-I Cedit and the modernity they represented. After the new model corps was created, the second regiment, or orta, of Nizam-I Cedit was trained and equipped to operate as mounted infantry rather than line infantry. This was a practical way of increasing mobility on and off the battlefield, and one that copied the original concept of dragoons.</long_description_text>

<key>rajput_zamindars</key>
<description_text>These heavy cavalry are armoured from head to toe in mail and plate, giving them a terrific shock value as they charge home.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nAn elite force, the Zamindars are not particularly swift, but they are intimidating. Any foe that gets into close combat with them may suffer a severe mauling, and they can simply ride right over lighter cavalry, disorganised troops or infantry that has not formed square. They are, however, vulnerable to artillery bombardment and disciplined musketry; it would be wasteful indeed to commit them against infantry in square.\n\nThe Zamindars were originally a class of almost-feudal tax farmers: men empowered to collect taxes from the peasantry. From being tax farmers, the Zamindars slowly accumulated all the responsibilities and power of lesser aristocracy or gentry. The title itself is a Persian borrowing, and means “landholder”. The Zamindars kept their holdings as long as taxes were forthcoming. Over the years, they became actual landowners, and gradually assumed military responsibilities as well. Some of these could be deferred by sending money, but it was also expected that these gentlemen should fight as irregulars for their overlords. The Zamindar tax system survived even in areas ruled by Europeans; there was a “change of management” and a change to where the tax revenues were sent, but that was all.</long_description_text>

<key>poligars</key>
<description_text>Poligars are unusual: elite light cavalry who wear armour. Despite the extra weight, they are still a terrifyingly swift force on the battlefield.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nThey generally wear helmets and cuirasses, often of the highest quality; Indian weapon makers need acknowledge few equals. They carry swords, and have skill enough to use them well in melee. Poligars also have the speed to ride down light troops such as skirmishers, and to pursue broken enemies. They should not be thrown away attacking disciplined infantry in square: they require luck to break such a target.\n\nLight cavalry were a fixed tradition of war in India, romanticised for their bravery and freebooting ways. Horsemanship was a prized and honoured skill throughout Indian society, as was fighting prowess. To make the most of both, Indian craftsmen produced some fascinating weapons, many of which were still in use in the 18th Century. The “patta”, for example, was a gauntlet-sword: a blade built into an armoured glove, making it almost impossible for the user to be disarmed, other than by being literally “disarmed” and maimed. It had a horizontal grip like the Indian punch-dagger, something that looked like a Chicago gangster’s brass knuckles crossed with a razor-sharp triangular knife.</long_description_text>

<key>barawardi</key>
<description_text>Barawardi are an elite light cavalry force. Despite wearing armour, they are surprisingly quick on the battlefield.</description_text>
<long_description_text>\n\nEquipped with helmets and cuirasses, they also carry swords. Their charge is not particularly powerful, but they can give a very good account of themselves in melee. Like other light cavalry, Barawardi can be used to ride down skirmishers and disorganised enemies. If properly handled, they may well be able to close with artillery units without suffering too many casualties. However, they should not be committed against heavier cavalry forces, as they will suffer disproportionate losses, and require exceptional luck, or a very good commander, to be able to break an infantry square.\n\nCavalry was the most important element in Mughal armies, and it seems likely that all cavalrymen were well-trained fighters - expected to be physically fit and proficient horsemen. Men served in ethnically-based units, so Afghans would fight under Afghan officers, Rajputs with their own, and so on. This naturally created unit camaraderie and cohesion, because men were unlikely to let their own kith and kin die unduly. The cavalry were, however, not always trusted: their mounts would be branded with both imperial and the unit commander’s marks. This was to stop soldiers selling their good horses and enlisting as infantrymen, or from substituting inferior horseflesh. With harsh laws to punish thieves, there was therefore no market for horses carrying army marks.</long_description_text>

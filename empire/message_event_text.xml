<text>Thanks to your efforts, the Jamestown settlement has prospered! No longer reliant on food from England, the settlers can start amassing wealth and expanding Britain’s colonies in America.\n\nThe Jamestown settlement has made a good start, but complacency is a dangerous thing. As word of the successful colonisation of the New World spreads, more people arrive from the Old World. Other European nations have taken note of your success. They too are looking to the New World with a view to possible expansion of their own interests. Although vast, these American lands are not endless. Confrontation is inevitable.</text>

<text>The French are defeated! You can claim a decisive victory for Britain over her long-standing enemy. The British now control North America, giving them the valuable resources of the Ohio Valley.\n\nBut this time of peace may be short lived. Britain’s policies in America are seen as overbearing and repressive by the colonists. Excessive taxes and restrictions on expansion have left the American people longing for freedom, not British rule. If this situation continues, the Thirteen Colonies will be forced into open warfare to win the right of self government.</text>

<text>Free Americans have thrown off their chains, and driven out their tyrannical British oppressors! At last, America is the Land of the Free, as well as the Home of the Brave. The remaining British troops leave American shores by the shipload and American independence has been fully, if reluctantly, accepted in London.\n\nWithout your efforts, none of this would have been possible. America would remain in the hands of the British. Your careful planning and well-timed aggression have brought Americans to a new dawn. The dark night of British rule is at an end. The bright dawn of a united America lies ahead.</text>

<text>Dissatisfaction with the monarchy has erupted into full-scale revolution. A revolutionary army has been formed to sweep away the old order and replace it with a new republic. In the capital, troops loyal to the throne have ensured the city remains under royal control, but traitors within the army have defected to the rebel cause. Men who were once friends have taken up arms against each other, and the country is in chaos. Do you wish to continue as a monarchy and attempt to crush the revolutionaries, or take control of the revolutionary army and attempt to storm the capital?\n\n</text>

<text>The ruling class&apos; dissatisfaction with your current ruler has reached boiling point, and civil war has broken out in your home region. Although control of the capital city has been maintained, powerful nobles have formed a rebel army and aim to replace the monarch with a candidate of their choosing. To make matters worse, the army is split on this issue and treacherous elements within it have sided with the rebels, leaving the country in chaos. Do you wish to defend the monarch and crush the rebel army, or take control of the rebels and attempt to storm the capital?\n\n</text>

<text>The lower order&apos;s dissatisfaction with the republican government has triggered a full-scale revolution, with the aim of forming a new republic free from the corruption and rot they believe permeates the current regime. Although disorder in the capital has been put down, and the city remains under government control, a revolutionary army has been formed - making violent confrontation inevitable. To make matters worse, traitors within the army have rebelled, and the country is in chaos.

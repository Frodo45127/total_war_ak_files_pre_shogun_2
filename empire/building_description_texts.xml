<short_description>A navy requires an administration to keep ships manned, supplied and at sea, to keep dockyards well stocked and ready, and bring order to the large organisation.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEven more than an army, a fleet is a highly technical and very expensive operation. The land-bound officers of an admiralty oversee every aspect of organisation, making sure that sea-going captains want for nothing when they finally engage the enemy. A dockyard is useless unless someone has organised the supply of timber; the timber remains stacked on the wharf until someone approves the naval architect’s plans; a completed ship is useless without officers and men; and the crew expects to eat, be paid and receive prize money. All of these tasks require clerks, secretaries and experienced admirals to keep the inevitable paperwork in order and thus the machinery of a navy working.\n\n\n\nHistorically, the head of the admiralty could expect to have a senior position in government and untrammelled access to his monarch or president. He was often spending a significant portion of the national wealth: navies and their dockyards were some of the biggest “industrial” enterprises in the world during the 18th Century. A powerful and effective navy guaranteed that trade could continue, unimpeded by nefarious foreigners!</long_description>

<short_description>A manufactory and store for military supplies of all kinds, an armoury is an important base for keeping armies in the field.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA central depot for arms, gunpowder, ammunition and supporting equipment allows a nation to standardise the weapons used by its armies and bring some order and economy to the procurement process. Small arms and cannons made to a standard pattern simplify training and allow field repairs, as parts cannibalised from one weapon will fit another.\n\nGunpowder supplies alone were a nightmare to keep organised and safe. During manufacture, powder was “corned” into grains of different sizes for different weapons. The larger the grains, the slower the powder burned, producing (lower) pressure in a barrel for a longer time. Powder for a cannon used large grains to give a steady push to a shot down the barrel, while musket powder burned at a higher rate producing greater pressure over a short time. Different grained powders were not interchangeable and could be lethal if used wrongly: small arms powder would split a cannon barrel and kill the crew! Gunpowder dust was even more dangerous, and someone carelessly walking through an armoury could cause an explosion by treading on it!</long_description>

<short_description>A national army requires central organisation, if only for pay and rations. Regiments may be the preserve of their commanding officers, but the functionaries control the purse strings!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn army generates paperwork of all kinds, and a secretariat grows to keep it all in order. There is an obvious need to make sure that units receive orders and supplies in a timely manner – and without unscrupulous suppliers stealing too much money. Headquarters staff must also organise transport in co-operation with the navy, keep a list of officers and their commissions, organise parades to impress the great and the good, and offer assistance to the civil power in times of need. \n\nHistorically, European armies were organised in an ad hoc fashion in the 18th Century. Usually, the biggest permanent formations in existence were regiments; armies were assembled as-and-when a crisis loomed under the command of favoured general. Even so, the concept of the central command telling colonels what to do with their regiments often met stiff opposition. The Ottoman and Mughal empires were better organised in theory, and did have larger permanent formations such as corps and divisions.</long_description>

<short_description>This is the centre of the army’s bureaucracy, where clerks and secretaries of state labour to make the fighting soldiers’ lives as awkward as possible!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is a truism that soldiers have little time for the bureaucrats who send them their orders. Some organisation above the level of a regiment is, however, a necessary evil: supplies must be purchased and distributed, transport organised, officers’ promotion lists kept in order, and generals given their orders. All this means paperwork, paperwork, and more paperwork! Money, and the power to spend it, are vitally important and all government secretariats are keen to hold on to both.\n\nHistorically, the government departments that ran armies in the 18th Century were far from being defence ministries or anything approaching a general staff. A central war planning function was almost unheard of, and often generals were quite unwilling to deal with the authorities at home, preferring to control everything themselves. In Europe the army organisations dealt with pay and rations: often spending time making sure that colonels did really raise regiments they were being paid for! The Ottomans were much more organised, and their armies were on a professional footing and raised on a national basis, even if some of the units raised were rather old fashioned.</long_description>

<key>army_encampment_european</key>
<short_description>Moving an army into an encampment well away from civilians is a useful thing to do. Soldiers no longer have easy access to the “demon drink” for a start!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSeparating troops from civilians also allows better training and indoctrination. Regiments have the space to practice drill and instil discipline in their men. Civilians also have funny ideas, and it is often best if common soldiers do not learn of their freethinking and sometimes disloyal ways.\n\nAn encampment, however, does not necessarily look very military. Apart from the fact that soldiers could carry on their civilian trades to supplement their army wages, an army encampment would also be thronged with women and children. Soldiers’ wives were expected to look after their men: wash, cook, clean, sew uniforms, act as nurses and even help bury the dead! A cunning officer who managed “the baggage” well could effectively double the number of hands there were for fetching and carrying. Among the children, young boys could find employment as drummers and musicians from as young as ten years of age. Historically, it was not unknown for officers to enrol their own children (even babies!) as musicians, so that they gained seniority from the date they joined the army!</long_description>

<short_description>This complex of fortified buildings provides housing, stabling and training facilities for military units. The accommodation may be spartan, but it is usually clean.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe lower ranks are usually housed in dormitory blocks, sometimes with their wives to act as servants and scullions. A substantial number of servants or slaves will be present to do much of the day-to-day labour when wives are barred. Officers receive better quarters, sometimes even their own houses, on the barracks’ grounds. \n\nThe provincial barracks still have something of a prison air, however, as they are designed to keep unwilling troops in as much as unfriendly folk out. Impressment, even kidnapping, is not an uncommon way to get men into uniform. \n\nHistorically, barracks were symbols of central control as well as housing for troops, particularly within the Mughal and Ottoman empires. The presence of large contingents of heavily armed men backed up the civil authority or even replaced it. However, within the Ottoman Empire the increasing use of military (and particularly the janissaries) as the government brought its own problems: these men were extremely conservative in outlook, fond of their own privileges, and unable to react well to changing circumstances.</long_description>

<key>army_staff_college_european</key>
<short_description>This institution educates soldiers in more advanced aspects of warfare, not just in the theory of tactics.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTactics may win battles, but wars are won thanks to information, strategy and, above all, supply. An army that is unfed and lost is no use to anyone. An army staff college produces officers with the skills needed to deal with the many details involved in keeping an army in the field. Apart from an understanding of strategy, officers are taught military illustration (the vital skill of producing accurate sketch maps and diagrams), some surveying, military law, how to behave like a proper gentleman (regrettably necessary in some cases), horsemanship, weapons handling and given character-building instruction. The end product is a man who can be an aide to a general in all situations.\n\nHistorically, the British, for example, had an inherent distrust of armies as tools of tyranny, and this may have contributed to the low priority given to raising professional standards. Pupils had to fund their studies from their own pockets at the Royal Military College! This had an additional advantage, of course, in ensuring that only candidates from the “right” social classes could afford to attend. Other nations were not so suspicious of giving soldiers necessary military skills.</long_description>

<key>artillery_park_european</key>
<short_description>An artillery park is a store for cannons, howitzers and mortars and their associated equipment; everything an artilleryman could need for his trade is here!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSmall arms may turn a rabble into a rebellion, but cannons create an army. Governments rightly want a monopoly on the ownership of heavy guns, and rightly see them as a measure of national power. A lack of guns severely hampers any military force, limiting it to little more than skirmish actions.\n\nOnce cast, artillery barrels could spend decades in storage. Providing that they were dry, there was little chance that they would come to much harm. When needed, a barrel was fitted to a gun carriage, ammunition and a limber found, and a piece was ready. Cannons could also be remade by fitting the barrel to a different carriage: a cannon for fortress use was mounted differently to a field gun.\n\nFire in an artillery park was a constant risk, bringing the danger of explosions, but damp conditions would ruin powder stocks just as surely. Water turned powder in a porridge, which then had to be dried very carefully and “corned” – turned into smooth grains of the right size – once again. Drying and crushing spoiled gunpowder was a ticklish task!</long_description>

<key>ashram</key>
<short_description>An ashram offers wisdom and learning to all those who come within its walls.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThis retreat from the cares of the world is a place of peace and tranquillity, as well as a place of profound learning and contemplation. Not quite a monastery, or matha, an ashram is bound by an informal code of conduct laid down by the religious leader or sage who leads it.\n\nTraditionally, ashrams are detached from everyday concerns, and concentrate on the spiritual development of the students. Some act as schools for children too. Even though they are places of peace, not everyone who makes a pilgrimage to an ashram has peaceful intent. The journey, both internal and external, can teach a warrior much about the business of warfare and some ashrams do offer a form of martial arts training. In the Hindu epic the Ramayana, warrior princes receive weapons training at an ashram.</long_description>

<short_description>Barracks provide more than simple housing blocks for regular military forces. The buildings also serve to remind the local people who is in charge. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThey are a statement in brick and stone that the military are present to defend the state and keep order. Usually constructed around a drill square, they are a carefully segregated military world deliberately kept apart from the civilians beyond. The walls present a blank, defensible, and intimidating face to the outside world. It can be important to keep troops away from the assorted temptations of flesh and the bottle. Civilians also harbour unsuitable, unmilitary ideas of disobedience and disloyalty – there must be limits to what an army can permit its men to think!\n\nHistorically, in Europe the fashion for building barrack blocks seemed to mirror the fascination with the Classical World of Greece and Rome. Among its other achievements, the Roman army had standardised designs for military buildings; armies in the 18th Century began to be similarly standardised. Governments employed good architects too: Nicholas Hawksmoor, for example, built the garrison barracks at Berwick-upon-Tweed for the British government. He was almost the equal of Sir Christopher Wren in talent if not in lasting fame, and produced many fine churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire of London.</long_description>

<short_description>State barracks provide more than housing for the military. They also serve to remind the local tax gathering hierarchy who is really in charge. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe design itself is intimidating and unfriendly, precisely as a reminder of the truth of power in a state. The walls are high and largely windowless to the outside so that troops in a state barracks can be kept apart from the civilian population beyond the gates (that this makes the barracks defensible if need be is a bonus). If the soldiers are needed for policing duties, it is better that they have not developed too many local attachments and sympathies. The barracks provide all the facilities that should be needed for a proper military life, although this ignores the reality of soldiers’ needs for recreation and relaxation!\n\nCaste and religious issues also entered into the construction of barracks in the Indian subcontinent. These issues mattered when housing troops, as did age-old regional and tribal rivalries; high-caste, hereditary (and therefore likely to be proficient) warriors would not react well if they were expected to break caste in their barracks. Religious restrictions could also play havoc with well-laid plans to house men and military animals.</long_description>

<short_description>Janissary barracks are the recruiting, training and housing centres for the most feared soldiers in the Ottoman army. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe janissaries are the “yeni cheri” (literally the “new soldiers”) although they are the earliest organised, regularly paid, state army in existence in Europe. Recruited as child soldiers from among the non-Muslims of the Ottoman world, indoctrination produces superb warriors and unquestioningly loyal state functionaries. \n\nThe long, proud and bloody tradition of janissary victory and excessive zeal was a result and a cause of an almost-monastic training regime. This tradition as a “warrior order” influenced in turn the ascetic architectural style of their barracks. That, at least, is the theory. Lacking local loyalties, and having had their family ties broken, they became the “enforcers of empire” as well as its defenders because they had no reason to be sympathetic towards anyone not in their ranks.\n\nHistorically, however, the janissaries did not remain elite warriors and nothing else. They extended their reach into all aspects of the state bureaucracy, practiced a variety of trades and professions in addition to soldiering, and often lived a less-than-celibate lifestyle. They also became conservative in outlook and a real obstacle to any kind of political, military or social reform.</long_description>

<key>bawdy_house_european</key>
<short_description>A bawdyhouse, whorehouse, bagnio, bordello, brothel, or “School of Venus” is a business given over to the selling of sexual services. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAlthough considered illegal and immoral in many cultures, prostitution takes place on what can only be described as an industrial scale in many cities. It is estimated that in London as many as one in six of the population had some link to the underworld of bawdyhouses. In other parts of the world there was less stigma attached to being a prostitute, but the life is always a hard one, open to exploitation and with the constant danger of violence from both clients and bawdyhouse owners. Bawdyhouses range from very high-class establishments where customers are by invitation only to backrooms in filthy taverns - and everything in between. \n\nLife was hard in 18th Century Europe for women; other than service, there were few honest jobs open to them and prostitution was always an easy option, especially for the young and good looking. It became the lot of many by default. Probably the most famous representation of the corruption of a woman was Hogarth’s “A Harlot’s Progress”, a series of six illustrations showing a young girl arriving in London, being inveigled into whoredom, and then gradually debauched, broken and finally dead (of the pox). It was the fate of all too many.</long_description>

<short_description>The influence of Ottoman culture and power extends to how people enjoy themselves. A Turkish bath is not just a place to get clean, socialise and catch up on gossip. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIntimate pleasures are also available – at a price. The bathhouse staff, or “tellak”, help customers wash themselves, much as the slaves did in Roman and Byzantine baths centuries before. Incidentally, the Byzantine designs influenced the layout and processes of the Turkish bath. However, tellak are young men (never women) recruited from among the non-Muslim subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire, selected for their good looks and pliant ways. A visit to a Turkish bath can therefore be a purely hygienic exercise, an opportunity for gossip, or a chance to indulge a taste for depravity.\n\nHistorically, Turkish baths did become popular across Europe although not necessarily always as disguised bawdyhouses. By the Victorian period, they were a popular – and unimpeachable – adjunct to many gentlemen’s clubs and the better sort of hotel.</long_description>

<key>cannon_foundry_european</key>
<short_description>Cannon foundries not only make guns, but also ammunition and the associated equipment for artillerymen. They are hot, dangerous places to work. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe casting of early cannons is more of an art than a science, and few of the weapons produced are standardised pieces. This is the result of casting limitations, the quality of iron or bronze available, and the manufacturing process (cannon casting was an adaptation of bell making). Most 6-pounders would be around the right calibre, but no two were truly identical. It was enough that the cannon did not burst and kill its crew, and hurled a shot in the general direction of the enemy. \n\nCannon foundries are also responsible for making the ball shot used by the weapons, but not the powder. No one but a raving lunatic would make gunpowder anywhere near a foundry, with the risk of stray sparks and consequent catastrophe! That said, making guns, like any casting work, is a dangerous business: if the sand moulds are even slightly damp then a steam explosion can occur. Anyone nearby is likely to be killed or maimed by hot metal and pieces of the mould. \n\nIn 1716, an explosion at the English foundry in Moorfields killed and injured many people when metal was poured into a damp mould. Among those hurt were Colonel Armstrong, the Surveyor-General of Ordnance. The foundry itself was totally destroyed.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe skills of animal husbandry, however, are very different from those of the hunter. Both need an understanding of animals, but a herder needs to know how to care for his charges, not just how to kill them. Other than the turkey, there were no domesticated animals available in North America before the coming of the Europeans. Some tribes adapted quickly to the new opportunities that cows, pigs and sheep provided, but in so doing they made themselves vulnerable to animal-borne disease. In hunter-gatherer cultures men do not live in close proximity to their beasts, and are unlikely to be infected with their ailments.</long_description>

<short_description>Cavalry barracks include extensive stable blocks and exercise yards for horses, as well as accommodation for the men.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCavalry units rarely stint themselves, and their barracks often have rather splendid mess facilities for the officers, who can hardly live in slums like common infantry riff-raff! Cavalry, of course, add style and dash to battles that would otherwise be vulgar brawls between grubby infantrymen. Thanks to this belief, cavalry regiments see themselves as superior in every way to everyone else in the army; even the private troopers share this arrogance. It is certainly true that cavalrymen are more expensive than other forces: not only have men to be found, trained, equipped and housed, but the same is true for the horses.\n\nThe military requirements for horseflesh were truly prodigious in the 18th Century. Finding sufficient mounts of the right quality was a constant problem for any cavalry commander, and may have been a contributory factor in the large numbers of dragoons in service. A cavalryman requires a good – for which read “expensive” – horse, because he and his mount are the weapon as they charge home; a dragoon can be mounted on any old nag, as his horse is primarily a means of transport. Providing it can carry him and his gear, it does not have to be stylish, or a thoroughbred.</long_description>

<key>ceramics_factory_european</key>
<short_description>A ceramics factory produces pottery on an industrial scale; each run produces an enormous batch of wares, without any real need for skilled potters.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe factory normally has a series of coal-fired kilns, so production can be more or less continuous. One kiln is filled with unfired wares while another is firing, a third is cooling, a fourth being carefully unpacked and so on. Coal is the fuel because charcoal is simply not available in the necessary quantities.\n\nThe pottery produced is both relatively cheap and of a consistently high quality: mass-produced standard designs add a touch of refinement to the life of the working classes, allowing them to own almost the same goods as their social betters. Relatively unskilled (and cheap) labourers produce these standard designs, as the production process has no need of individual creativity.\n\nJosiah Wedgwood (1730-1795) was the most famous of the “industrial potters”, producing high quality goods at an affordable cost for the burgeoning middle classes. His ceramic designs – Queen’s Ware (1762), Black Basalt (1768) and Jasper (1774) – were famous for their style and beauty, and influence styles still in production today.</long_description>

<short_description>The virtue and value of hard, honest toil are lessons worth teaching, along with a clear understanding of God’s universe and Man’s place within it.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Protestant faith has always encouraged learning and the associated hard work of study among its faithful. Indeed, intellectual effort and its rewards are seen as being as worthy as physical labour, something that reflects the Protestant work ethic. It has also encouraged a degree of curiosity and free thinking about Creation, although within sensible limits. Curiosity is one thing, non-conformism and radicalism something else entirely, and hardly welcome in society at large!\n\nHistorically, the Protestant work ethic maintained that hard work and subsequent worldly success were indications of personal salvation. This, supposedly, encouraged the faithful to work all the harder. It is, however, a simplistic analysis to see that this lead directly to the intellectual, industrial and financial successes of Protestant nations in the 18th Century. The end of Catholic strictures against usury (money lending) almost certainly helped fuel mercantile and industrial progress.</long_description>

<short_description>The Church has always needed educated men to fill its ranks. It is also important to teach the True Faith to the children of the wealthy.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn a time when basic education is not a right but a bought-and-paid-for privilege, the education provided by Church schools is often very good, as well as being the only option. There is, of course, a Scriptural emphasis in what is taught, but the sons of merchants, nobles and the wealthy can gain a good grounding for life and, possibly, further education. A few gifted pupils may be offered charitable scholarships, but these are few and the recipients are never permitted to forget that they should be showing appropriate gratitude. Patronage must always be appreciated!\n\nHistorically, learning had been the preserve of the established Church in many countries. A priest was both tutor and confessor in many communities and households. It also made sense for the Church to control access to education, for that way heresy and dissent could be stamped out early. For non-conformist preachers, offering education to paying clients was also a way of subsidizing their meagre income and spreading the Word of the Lord in the process.</long_description>

<short_description>A coaching inn is a large public house with rooms where weary travellers can rest overnight.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA coach or post-chaise is the only practical and vaguely civilized method of getting from A to B overland, other than hiring a horse. Regular runs exist between many major towns, run on a commercial basis by private companies, necessitating a series of coaching inns roughly a day’s travel apart where passengers can rest overnight. Horses must also be changed at regular intervals if speed is to be maintained. Coach journeys of any length demand epic levels of stamina from passengers, hence the need for good inns. The condition of most roads is execrable, the suspension on most coaches is somewhat lacking, the schedule is punishing and the risk of robbery by “gentlemen of the road” should not be underestimated. \n\nThe locals, of course, also drink and eat at a coaching inn, and a good one will have a high reputation for its cellar and its provender. The usual selection of “entertainment” for gentlemen travellers is available, always at the right price!  \n\nThe word coach, by the way, comes from the Hungarian “Kocsi szekér” meaning “wagon of Kocs”, the place where the first coach was produced.</long_description>

<short_description>A tavern is a drinking establishment where all manner of drink, food and entertainment are available – always providing that the money is forthcoming!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDrink is one of the solace’s of a long working day. There are, of course, religious and social taboos about getting drunk, but these rarely bother tavern owners or their customers! A tavern provides a place to drink cheaply, pick up the local news, gossip, gamble (cockfighting is a popular pastime) and generally have a few hours respite from the day’s labour. It is often the “other” centre of a community, where the real business of running a town goes on, well away from official interference.\n\nA tavern is distinguished from an inn because it does not offer overnight accommodation, although rooms for private functions – and discreet entertainment of an intimate or personal nature – may well be part of the service.</long_description>

<short_description>Coffee drinking is a civilized way of passing time, exchanging gossip and keeping up with the important news of the day. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIslamic law is quite strict in forbidding some food and drink for the faithful; intoxicating alcoholic drinks fall into this category. This is why coffee drinking has become a social activity, oiling the wheels of society without any of the risks, dangers and shame of public intoxication. The drink itself is a stimulant, and some conservative imams disapprove of it as a result but this has not prevented its general acceptance across all social classes. The coffee house has also become a place of entertainment too.\n\nHistorically, Middle Eastern rulers did not always regard coffee drinking as being a desirable pastime for the general population. Its stimulating effect was seen as somewhat suspect when the drink became wildly popular, although this is precisely what had made coffee popular with Sufis. When the drink reached Europe, coffee houses rapidly became popular. Some turned into business venues where financial deals were struck: the massive insurance business Lloyds of London started life as traders in a coffee house!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nLong houses are similar to wigwams, in that they use a wooden pole frame covered with elm bark. There are holes at intervals along the roof to allow smoke from the fires burning inside the building to escape. During the winter months the two main entrances are covered with animal pelts to keep out the cold winds. \n\nLong houses are big enough for an entire extended family or clan and have raised platform areas for sleeping mats, leaving large areas of the lower floor for socializing.</long_description>

<short_description>Warehousing a cash crop allows control over the supply of goods, and therefore greater profits as the vagaries of market prices have less effect. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBy holding onto a crop until a market is “right”, plantation owners can get the best price for their harvest. They can also calm the volatility of the commodity’s market by evening out the supply over the course of a year, rather than having a harvest glut and then a shortage for the rest of the time. A warehouse also allows plantation owners to wait until the season and winds are favourable for a fast sea journey back to the homeland; shipping losses and transit times are both reduced. Finally, Warehousing also allows smaller crops to be consolidating for shipping back to the home market, and for the crop to be properly graded. The finest parts of the harvest can be sold at the highest price, rather than simply being lumped in with any old dross.</long_description>

<short_description>A college offers an academic education – a veneer of civilized sophistication – to the sons of the aristocracy and gentry.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA college education is expensive, and there are few charity-funded places or scholarships for the less socially fortunate. It is a privileged man who goes to college: money or patronage are needed more than intellect. Although there is discussion and teaching of the radical ideas of science and philosophy to the students, the college masters are likely to have a conservative outlook. Most of the students are the same: they are from the top rungs of society’s ladder, and they have little interest in seeing the natural “status quo” altered.\n\nHistorically, attending college was probably the most boring element in the education of “young gentlemen”, although the actual work required was not that arduous. The “Grand Tour” became fashionable during the 18th Century, when the rich would wander Italy (Greece being an Ottoman possession), taking in the sites of Antiquity and the great works of the Renaissance. In the process they would spend a fortune on Classic-period statuary and relics, paintings by the great masters, and anything else that took their fancy. Quite reasonably, the less aesthetically refined, but well funded, would seek an exotic “education” in local taverns and bawdyhouses!</long_description>

<short_description>A secular college offers a good education to the sons of the ruling classes, taking in both Classics and new-fangled ideas. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe education offered is, however, completely non-sectarian. It focuses on Indian classics – and this includes some religious works – literature, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, natural philosophy, and the other accomplishments of gentlemen, such as hunting and swordplay (for self-defence). The aim is to produce administrators, warriors and intellectuals who can run the vast holdings of the native princes, and have a grasp of the finer things in life. Education is valuable and even an end in itself, but a certain practicality must be considered.\n\nIn the previous century, the Kerala school of mathematicians and astronomers in southern India had made great strides in both fields, easily rivalling the work of European mathematicians of the age. Neither the Indians nor the Europeans had any idea that others were at work on the same problems. In this, the Indians were following a long and proud tradition of intellectual achievement, invention and learning on the sub-continent. Many ideas that diffused to Europe through Islamic scholars owe their origins to Indian thought. The fusion of Indian and Islamic knowledge under the Mughals continued this tradition, and was to survive – for a while at least – the coming of European traders and invaders.</long_description>

<short_description>A college of divinity specialises in religious education, inculcating all the minutiae of the Protestant faith in its students.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe graduates of this school are armed with theological arguments against other branches of Christianity, and a sense of mission to spread the truth of Protestantism as widely as possible. Intellectual effort is expected over and above simple-minded faith.\n\nOriginally, many western European universities were based on religious teaching establishments, where divinity was the main (and sometimes only) field of study. Their graduates were granted doctorates, indicating that they were qualified to teach theology to others. However, the universities were also often tied to the established Catholic Church, and Protestantism was a revolt precisely against the failings of established religion. Where Protestantism replaced Catholicism as the official state religion, teaching changed to remove “papist” doctrine and error. This did not, however, prevent further, lesser schisms such as the rise of non-conformist sects like Methodism. These nonconformists also wished to teach their views, and they were often denied teaching places at universities.</long_description>

<short_description>A college offers an academic, secular education to the sons of the wealthy and influential.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is expensive and exclusive, but provides a good basis for a career in both private business and the state administration. Society does not expect the college to be a hotbed of radical ideas, but to produce able, polished men who can occupy the highest positions with confidence. If nothing else, the personal contacts made will be extremely useful to a graduate, even if his academic attainments are a little lacking.\n\nThere is also a distinctly Turkish flavour to the education on offer, as Ottoman culture and achievements are (rightly, in the view of both teaching staff and students) celebrated and studied. There is a socially and nationally cohesive view of the world that is the legacy of an education here. This is not quite the same as a purely Islamic education on offer elsewhere.\n\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire was always in need of able administrators. This was one of the reasons why it came to rely on the disciplined and educated military corps of janissaries to act as imperial functionaries. This, in turn, caused problems as the janissaries became more interested in their own perquisites than in their duties as civilian officials.</long_description>

<short_description>With the addition of exchanges, shipping agents, customs houses, even more warehouses and even more docks, a basin becomes an economic powerhouse. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA commercial basin opens up new opportunities for trade, as agents now put together cargoes and charter vessels for merchants who would otherwise be unable to trade. Money, rather than sea experience, becomes the driving force for success, and trade does not even need to go through the basin to make money for the men of property!\n\nThe infamous triangle of trade between Bristol and Liverpool in England, Africa and the Caribbean sugar islands is possibly one of the most profitable trades ever invented. Manufactured goods, guns, cloth and trinkets went to Africa, where they were traded to the local warlords. Slaves, carried in the most horrendous conditions imaginable, made up the cargo for the middle run, across the Atlantic. In the Caribbean, the survivors were sold, and the ships loaded with sugar and rum for the run back to Britain. There was a handsome profit on each leg, and the ships were never idle. Even better, the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool never needed to see the suffering their commerce caused, always assuming that they cared.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nShipping goods to a home market is only one way of making money from trade. There is more to be earned from shipping valuable goods to new markets in other countries. The ability to warehouse an incoming cargo and only release it when the price is right also increases profits.\n\nMost maritime nations – Britain and Holland in particular – had rules that enforced a native nationals-only rule for carrying goods into their ports. Anything, for example, that arrived in the Port of London should have come in a “British bottom”. This kind of protectionism in trade also applied to colonies and indirectly caused at least one war, the War of Jenkins’ Ear (1739-48), between Spain and Britain. The Spanish were alleged to have chopped off the ear when Jenkins was caught trading in Spanish territory; the British had previously agreed a treaty not to do this. The war became part of the War of Austrian Succession (1740-48) but, incidentally, marks the first public occasion that “God Save the King” was used as the British national anthem, to celebrate the capture of Puerto Bello in Panama by Admiral Vernon.</long_description>

<short_description>A conservatorium is a school for musicians, specialising in the highly cultured music required for church and state occasions. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile the emphasis is on music for a cultured and upper class audience, the education provided by a conservatorium is practical and vocational. Those who pay the fees intend to earn a living as musicians, at the very least in the orchestra of a wealthy patron and, at best, as a composer of some renown, able to choose between commissions, patrons and even nations! A conservatorium has to provide what its customers want, and they generally produce well-polished musicians who can pass themselves off, when needed, as professionals or members of the minor gentry.\n\nHistorically, many of these schools began as either royal academies of music or choristers’ schools for the great cathedrals. All music had to be performed live, and the need for new, innovative and exciting music at every state or religious event required an enormous number of musicians – and talented composers with prodigious work rates! Great composers, such as Mozart or Handel, were celebrities and royal houses outbid each other in an effort to obtain their services as a prestigious ornament to a court.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe dancers draw on Hindu temple traditions, but their dances are secular. All styles of dance can fall into the category of Nautch, but the dancers are always well-presented and graceful girls. Indeed, a career as a Nautch girl can be a way for a girl to work her way out of poverty or a low social caste. Good performers can find work in the courts of rulers from nawabs to zamindars, and their presence adds considerable lustre to any formal event. Muslim rulers also employ Nautch dancers to entertain their guests.\n\nHistorically, Nautch dancing rose to prominence under the Mughal emperors but they continued to be popular, even when the British East India Company took over much of the administration of the Indian sub-continent.</long_description>

<short_description>Calligraphy is the art of writing and, by extension, the art of producing books. It is a worthy accomplishment to produce beautiful script. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe art of calligraphy and the skill of writing beautifully are important because they preserve and communicate the revelations of the Qur&apos;an. \n\nThe work of calligraphers is prized and collected for its inherent beauty, as well as its meaning. The mastery of the many styles and forms is a lifetime’s work, but one that can bring rich rewards. A student cannot sign work until he had received an “icazet” or diploma, granted for producing an examination piece in the presence of several teachers. Standards are exceptionally high, but a recognized calligrapher could expect to have his work treasured by his clients.\n\nCalligraphy also forms the basis of some Islamic decoration (along with geometric arabesque art) and has a figurative style where interweaved words create images. These “calligrams” are both intricate and incredibly beautiful artworks. Calligraphy also has influences on other artistic endeavours, such as the creation of elaborate carpets and textiles.</long_description>

<short_description>An area of great power and energy; used for a variety of rituals, including the rain dance and ghost dance.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOne of the most powerful holy grounds is the medicine wheel. These areas are a representation of the path an individual must walk in their life time. By standing on each of the spokes a man can understand what it is to walk another’s path and fully appreciate all aspects of life and nature. \n\nHistorically, the most famous medicine wheel is found at Big Horn in Wyoming; it was the first to be created and was built on a ridge of Medicine mountain. People visited the site seeking harmony with the powerful spirits that inhabited it, searching for a greater understanding of the mysteries of mother earth.</long_description>

<short_description>Artisans and their craft workshops are the basis of all manufacturing work and trade. They are vital to the growth of a local economy. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCraft workshops are the basis of a thriving economy. Each craftsman and his family work from dawn to dusk to produce a bale of cloth, a carpet, cutlery, swords, guns – anything, in fact, that needs to be made. The system has hardly changed in centuries.\n\nCraftsmen are paid piecework rates, making it in their interests to have the whole family labouring away. Each workshop produces a complete item from start to finish of the manufacturing process, and there is little organisation involved in producing the finished goods. This small-scale approach does impose limits on overall production.\n\nHistorically, it was possible for craft-based techniques to produce large quantities of goods, but only by having entire communities working in the same craft. The steel town of Sheffield, England, became a centre of cutlery making (and later steel production) on the strength of its craft-based workshops. The coming of mills would sweep away generations of expertise, as jobs were de-skilled and mechanised.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA workshop is a vital resource for the community, whatever it produces. These small-scale industries have a large role to play in the tribe’s prosperity and survival.\n\nBeads, for example, were an important craft product in Native American society. They were used in ceremonial jewellery and clothing and as a form of currency where barter was not used. Despite the large number of people involved in craftwork, the tribes never used anything more powerful than human muscle in their industries.</long_description>

<key>deep_gem_shaft_european</key>
<short_description>The term for a gem field is an “occurrence”, and often the site has a very small surface area. Eventually the easy stones are found, and the miners must dig a shaft to find more. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGiven that miners are paid only for the gemstones they find and not for any other work, the shaft sunk into the ground is often extremely crude. Shoring up and pumping out the shaft may seem like sensible activities, but both of these things go unpaid and therefore undone. The mine owners do not care about casualties: men who die need no wages, merely hold up production and stop others earning. \n\nThe shafts often have to go deep indeed, as gemstones are deposited in very small areas. This does not matter. All that matters is finding riches. Few miners worry that side tunnels are little more than death traps, given the chances of discovering the perfect stone!</long_description>

<short_description>A dockyard can carry out major shipbuilding work, and usually includes a large number of associated artisans and tradesmen from coopers to victuallers. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDockyards also have extensive shore facilities, such as ropewalks, forges, furnaces and, possibly most important of all, seasoning sheds. Using “green” timber for shipbuilding results in vessels that can “work” (have a little flexibility), something that French shipbuilders regard as a good thing, even though it means that their ships leak in heavy seas. Seasoning wood for months or years is prudent, and most other navies follow this practice.\n\nOn more than one occasion in the century Royal Navy raiding parties made a point of destroying stocks of timber – in particular masts – stored in enemy dockyards. The loss of timber stocks not only set back shipbuilding by many years, but also ensured that battle damage was hard to make good too. Burning timber rather than stealing it must have gone against the natural inclinations of many RN officers and seamen, as their prize money for the goods was also going up in smoke!</long_description>

<short_description>A drill school creates the common practices for an army, and turns a collection of disparate forces into a precise and clockwork killing machine.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn an age when all battlefield manoeuvres must be performed exactly, drill is a necessary part of all military training. Constant repetition of the actions involved in loading and firing a piece are useful in themselves, but of more use is the unthinking obedience to superiors that is, literally, drilled into every man in the ranks. When a soldier is concentrating on his place in line and on not attracting the attention of his sergeant or officer, he will not worry about what the enemy might be doing. Drill has another benefit for an army too: men busy on the parade ground cannot be getting into trouble or finding a tavern!\n\nIn Britain, one aspect of 18th Century drill survives to this day in the form of a ceremonial parade called “Trooping the Colour”, carried out on the monarch’s official birthday on Horse Guards, in London. Originally, this parade was not a celebration but a practical exercise: the men needed to know what “the colours”, or flags, of their unit looked like. The fact that the monarch gets to review the soldiers is not the point! In battle, the men would need to be able to rally to, and then defend, these colours on command.</long_description>

<key>drydock_european</key>
<short_description>A dry dock is a large brick or stone basin with a set of watertight gates. Once a ship has floated in, the lock gates are shut and the dock drained. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWithin the dry dock, the ship is supported on blocks, and extra timbers are used to wedge firmly upright as the water is removed. By carefully timing the movement of a ship to take advantage of high and low tides, the amount of pumping (by hand) is minimised. Movements into and out of the dock are tidal, and work must be finished by the next high tide. \n\nThe advantages of being able to work on a warship and then float it away are considerable. Dry docks are equally useful for construction and repair, and are often at the centre of a large complex of workshops specialising in every aspect of shipbuilding.\n\nThe organisation required for all this activity means that the craft-based skills of the master shipwright are still valuable, but naval architects producing plans, drawings and schedules are now a vital part of the process. Naturally, the master of the docks can treat the entire enterprise as his own (as long as he delivers the ships needed) and award contracts as he sees fit to his friends and cronies! Officials making profits from the government’s investment was an accepted cost of business and, provided the men were not too greedy, an assurance that they were looking after their interests and those of the navy!</long_description>

<short_description>Military engineering is a highly technical field of study, best carried out by trained officers and not left to common soldiery with mattocks!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe school teaches all the specialised skills that an officer of engineers will require, such as surveying, the use of explosives, military architecture, construction, the arts of siege warfare, military illustration (used to create maps) and much else besides. Some mundane tactical skills are taught as well, but engineers are not expected to command armies and issue orders to gentlemen. It is their lot to position guns and advise when a breach in a fortress’ walls is “practicable”, and could fall to an assault.\n\nSappers and miners, like artillery experts, had long history of being permanent retainers in royal armies of the medieval and Renaissance periods; siege works needed experts to demolish castle walls. Thanks to the likes of the French Marshal Vauban (1633-1707) and his magnificent fortifications, the need for military engineers to create, or break into, defences grew, not lessened, during the 18th Century. The elaborate and layered defences that he and his successors developed required skilled architects and builders. Engineer officers became a corps of highly educated experts, while leaving the hard, mucky work of digging to the rank-and-file sappers and pioneers, of course!</long_description>

<key>fishing_fleet_european</key>
<short_description>A deep sea fishing fleet can bring in a larger catch than inshore boats. Most of the catch has to be salted or pickled for return to port. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSalting relies on preserving the caught fish in dry salt in barrels or boxes. This is the method favoured by many fishermen along the North African coast. Pickling preserves the catch in brine (sea water with even more added salt). In both cases, the salt stops any fungus or other rot setting in, and may even improve the taste of the fish, although the fish will need to soak in fresh water before it can be cooked.\n\nAll of this preservative work is required because the fleet ranges far out to sea for days at a time, looking for big shoals of fish. The cargo can take weeks to reach port, and even longer to reach inland markets, and if salting was not used the catch would be both disgusting and lethal to anyone eating it!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nNo one can afford to ignore a plentiful food supply, even if gathering it means braving the ocean swell. Sea fishery is a risky undertaking, but one that can feed many. The spearing skills and equipment used by each man are the same as for freshwater fish. Once taken, fish can be smoked or salted to last the long winter months.\n\nHistorically the North American tribes did not really have the sailing technology to exploit the vast stocks of sea fish that were to be found off the coast. However, given that the potential of this food source was demonstrated by the Europeans, it is likely they would have exploited it given the chance.</long_description>

<short_description>Furs are a mark of luxury and status, as well as a practical way of keeping warm. The demand can strip areas of their native fauna. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAlthough the medieval sumptuary laws (that defined who could wear what) are largely ignored in Europe, the wearing of fur is often restricted to royalty and other high-status individuals: the British House of Lords sets out regulations for the fur trimming on peers’ robes, while furs are often reserved for warlords in the East. Lesser status furs are available to anyone with the money to spend.\n\nIn Europe, even artists benefited from the fur traders’ work: sable-hair brushes (actually made from a kind of weasel) are extremely good for watercolours, as they come to a fine point and hold paint well. Watercolour landscapes became very fashionable during the 18th Century, both to own and to paint. Painting watercolours became an accomplishment for marriageable young ladies, a delicate art to show off their sensibilities. In the process, watercolours became an important part of tourism, as they allowed the rich to record what they had seen on their travels.</long_description>

<short_description>There is an almost insatiable demand for furs. Pelts are traded for trinkets and manufactured goods, including firearms.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrade in furs is highly profitable, as almost any item can be parleyed into a good deal for pelts. Shipping furs back to home markets can be more of a problem, as transport in the wilderness relies heavily on finding navigable river routes.\n\nBy 1700 the Hudson Bay Company was well established and expanding its operations into previously French-dominated territories. It had been set up in 1670, in London, by a royal charter to trade with the natives of Canada. The company traded English wool blankets to the native tribes in return for beaver pelts, and became the de facto colonial British government in Canada. Some of its trading posts became the sites of substantial fortifications. In this, it matched the East India Company’s success in the East. It did much better than the EIC in surviving to the present day; then again, the EIC had a spectacular lack of success in persuading Mughal India to take heavy woollen blankets as trade goods!</long_description>

<short_description>Fur traders are explorers and backwoodsmen, practical men in search of the wealth that the wilderness contains: animal pelts. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nExploiting natural animal resources is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of making profit from virgin territory. It takes training, luck and money to extract mineral wealth; almost anyone – if they are tough enough – can hunt, or trade with the natives, for pelts.\n\nHistorically, men looking for animal pelts for the finest furs explored swathes of North America and the Siberian wilderness. In America, it was beaver pelts that drove the traders further into the hinterland; in Siberia it was sable pelts that drove traders deeper into the wilds. Demand for furs at home in Europe was almost insatiable, probably helped by a cold period in the climate and a singular lack of effective central heating!</long_description>

<short_description>With the desire for furs ever increasing, trading in them is a lucrative business.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrading in fur can often be a long-winded affair until the final customer is reached, as moving furs from the wilderness relies heavily on finding river routes to transport them. The use of wooden canoes allows the furs to be sent great distances in a much shorter time than if they had been sent by land.\n\nHistorically, many European outsiders that became &apos;woodsmen&apos; actually took up the native way of life, adopting their clothing, lodgings and customs. Some married native women, thus creating bonds to the tribe that came with the benefit of free and easy trade.</long_description>

<short_description>Mining is a dirty, dangerous business. Men hack out all manner of valuable minerals by hand, risking life and limb for the mine owners’ profits. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLit only by candles (which they must buy themselves) or lamps with naked flames, most miners are labouring in conditions that resemble hell on earth. In some mines firedamp (methane) is a constant risk thanks to the candles – an explosion can happen at any time. The risk of a slow death is there too: stone dust and poisonous minerals such as arsenic ruin a man as surely as any explosion. \n\nThere are also accidents. Miners are paid only for the valuable minerals that they extract, so there is little incentive to carry out much work for safety’s sake. Pit props may keep the roof from collapsing, but putting them in does not earn any payment – the miners may even be charged for the materials! And it is not just men who labour below ground. Women often pull carts from the working face to the surface. Children need less space and air than adults, and make ideal support workers, clearing tunnels and bringing food and water to the miners. In smaller seams, children are the perfect labourers.\n\nAll of this is secondary, however, to the business of making money, and mining can be a very profitable industry.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nExtracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.\n\nIt is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it.</long_description>

<short_description>In an absolute monarchy, the monarch’s person is the wellspring of all authority. Lackeys – no matter how mighty – serve at the monarch’s pleasure and need take no account of the locals!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAbsolute monarchy is an effective and sometimes brutal form of government. The monarch’s powers are not limited in any way. What the monarch decrees simply happens. If it does not, heads roll, often literally! \n\nThe machinery of provincial government receives the same authority from the Crown. A governor, thalur or bey (depending on the nation in question) has the power to do almost anything to his subjects, providing he delivers what his monarch requires – and this is usually tax income and soldiers. Any other considerations can be put to one side; it is the duty of subjects to obey in an absolute state, and those who dare to argue back are quite rightly treated as faithless rebels. \n\nHistorically, absolutism was the main form of government in many 18th Century states. Louis XIV of France was speaking the truth when he reputedly claimed “L’État, c’est moi!” Like other absolutists and their apologists, he sincerely believed that he was responsible for his actions only to God.</long_description>

<short_description>A constitutional monarch’s powers are limited by law, as are those of appointed governors. Visible consultation can ease the use even of these limited powers. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile the people do not have to be listened to, it is a wise course of action to consult them in local matters. The process may be real or a fig leaf, but one result is that the council takes the blame for poor decisions, not the Crown and its governors, beys or thalurs! The propertied classes and local dignitaries on the council almost certainly owe their advisory status entirely to their wealth or social position: democracy may play a part, but the franchise is likely to be very limited indeed. The lower social orders are unlikely to be given any say in how they are governed.\n\nThis lack of broad consultation is not as bad as it sounds. The government cannot overstep the bounds of its power. There is a contract (or even an informal understanding) between government and governed as to what the Crown may do without the consent of the people (the people being those with a stake in the country – men of property in other words). Historically, this is essentially the model that the British arrived at: the King and his ministers ruled, but needed Parliament to raise taxes and pay for everything!</long_description>

<short_description>A republic stands for government of the people, for the people and (to some extent) by the people, and it is here that the people’s representatives meet to discuss local issues. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nRepublics maintain representative government structures at a local level, with each province eventually having its own assembly as it becomes rich or populous enough to justify it. Locally elected worthies enact local laws, appoint or form the judiciary, raise militias, and exercise all the other functions of government, sometimes with a degree of common sense.\n\nRepresentative government is the basis of a republic, although the qualifications needed to be a voter are often restrictive. Representation of “the people” is not necessarily democratic: most republics prevent the unwashed masses from voting by having property, age, sex, class, or religious restrictions. Of these, property and social class qualifications are by far the most common – the logic being that only men of substance have a properly vested interest in their nation’s survival, and the wisdom to exercise their franchise correctly. Historically, even the Founding Fathers of America were very careful in establishing that only men with property could vote – universal suffrage was an alien and frightening idea!</long_description>

<short_description>The High Chief has the final say, and his dwelling reflects his status</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTribal structure relies on everyone knowing his place and recognising where power is vested. The tribal sub-chiefs need a supreme leader to bring them together, to be a voice for the people. The High Chief fulfils this role, acting as father to his tribe with, if he is wise, the guidance of the medicine men and older warriors.\n\nHistorically, tribal leaders were the key in determining tribal policies, especially towards the invading Europeans. King Philip’s War of 1675-6 seems to have been the result of Metacomet (or “King Philip” as the English settlers called him) realising that trading tribal lands for goods was the height of folly, despite what previous leaders had done.</long_description>

<short_description>This magnificent palace is a pale reflection of the monarch’s glory, power and wealth, not those of the governor’s person. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn an absolute monarchy, there is a great chain of authority that stretches down from the monarch’s person even to the lowliest of his subjects. Everyone has a place, sanctioned by time, custom and the approval of the monarch and no one is exempt from the awful majesty of the sovereign’s power. This is especially true of governors away from the royal court. They may rule from marble palaces, but they do so not in their own right but by authority granted from the Crown. If any of them ever forget that the grandeur and luxury that surround them are entirely borrowed, the penalties for personal aggrandisement are terrible indeed. Having been raised up, they have an awfully long way to fall.\n\nIn reality, many governor’s residences in absolute monarchies combined luxury (for who was to say when the king would visit?) with enough barracks and stables to house a small army. Absolutism always relied on the concepts of the “rod and the axe” to maintain authority, although by the 18th Century a good stock of gunpowder and a fine collection of artillery did better service.</long_description>

<short_description>An imposing meeting place for the “great and good” to offer their advice to the local governor, and influence the course of local politics. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe monarch acts within the law and with the consent of the governed in a constitutional monarchy. This is what distinguishes the system from the crude absolutism of rule by the sovereign’s whims and foibles: laws limit what the Crown can do, what taxes can be levied, and how the people can be treated. In such a system, it is wise for the people to be consulted, and to be seen to be consulted, even if the sovereign’s appointed governors actually make the decisions. Often, executive power is handed down to a local council of worthies: men wealthy and well connected enough to have a stake in the survival of the state. They can be trusted to act loyally, in the best interests of the monarch, themselves and the people.\n\nHistorically, appointed governors often took it upon themselves to select local men to advise them about local matters. For example, there was a tradition in English colonies overseas for landowners to offer their services and best advice to the London-appointed governors, whether it was welcome or not!</long_description>

<short_description>This magnificent building is the embodiment of the Republic and of the people’s continuing involvement in their own laws and governance.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe state capitol of a republican province is the seat of government, a place where the people’s representatives can meet to pass local laws, appoint judges, and generally see to the good government of their region. At regional level government is usually divided into an upper and lower chamber, although both are elected. The regional governor himself may still be an appointee of the central government, a useful way of balancing local and national interests. All that said, little expense is spared on the capitol building itself, as this is a considerable source of pride and unity.\n\nDespite the seemingly democratic nature of the system, there is no guarantee that anything approaching all the adult population will actually have a vote. Historically, the extension of the franchise to the popular majority is a late development in many democracies and republics. The US state of New Jersey, for example, allowed women the vote after the Revolution in 1775, only to take the right away in 1807!</long_description>

<short_description>As a province grows, the central government appoints its own governor with greater powers, rather than relying on the services of a member of the local, minor gentry. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nNo matter what his title – Lord Lieutenant (to the monarch), Governor, Pasha, Thalur – the man appointed to oversee a province is a minor monarch, even in a republic! His main duties are tax raising and defence, and he is the government’s man rather than a senior member of the local community.  He is both protector and enforcer. He can enforce the law as he sees fit, ignore it when inconvenient and even grant pardons. He can impress men into military service and use them against any who dare to rebel. He has the power of life and death over his subjects – although he may have to use the justice system rather than simply having people shot. And, best of all, in an age of “interest” he has the power to fill his own and his friends’ purses at the state’s expense.\n\nHistorically, office holders in the 18th Century (almost regardless of country or government style) seemed to have trouble keeping the state’s money out of their own pockets. It was acceptable for a man to appoint himself or a friend as a contractor, tax farmer or monopolist and make a handsome profit.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive setting for musical performances allows the audience to delight in novel entertainments, and admire the good taste of the house’s patron.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLittle expense is spared on a grand opera house, particularly in the “front of house” areas where the audience are to be found. A grand opera house is a magnificent structure, the equal of any palace in terms of luxurious appointments and detailing to overawe the visitors. The staged works can be equally elaborate, featuring enormous casts and intricate settings. This is conspicuous consumption raised to a high art, even before the music starts!\n\nMany rulers in the 18th Century acted as a patron of the arts, and opera in particular. Apart from being fabulously and famously expensive (therefore demonstrating the patron’s wealth), the musical form was also growing in popularity and quality. The staging and music of opera advanced tremendously during the period, with works from composers of genius such as Mozart, Handel and Scarlatti. Emperor Joseph II of Austria, the “music king”, was particularly fortunate that his love of the art coincided with a flowering of musical talent in Europe. He used the arts as a subtle tool of nationalism, promoting a Germanic culture within Austria.</long_description>

<short_description>These formal gardens are a retreat from the hurly-burly of the everyday world, and a place where important guests can be entertained.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese are spaces where rulers, their important functionaries, ambassadors and the “great and good” can take their ease, enjoying the peace of shade, running water, natural beauty, and pleasant scents.\n\nThe design of Persian gardens influences the layout of a charbagh (the word itself has Persian origins), and the plants that are grown. The central idea is to reflect or recreate Paradise in an earthly setting, albeit with the limitations that humans always bring to their works. The garden is divided into four sections, each with its own reflecting pools, formalised streams and fountains, and carefully selected plantings. Water features are important because they represent the four rivers of Paradise. The plants carry symbolic meanings too, for those educated enough to “read” the garden, such as the cypress trees representing death. Often verses of sacred texts are carved into the stonework, or inlaid in wall tiles, as a further aid to contemplation.\n\nThe most famous charbagh in existence is probably best known for the tomb it contains: laid out in 1632, the gardens of the Taj Mahal in Agra, are a superb formal setting for any building.</long_description>

<short_description>Formal gardens are a place of quiet contemplation, where the cares and burdens of the state can be set aside for a while. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe tulip is a native flower of, among other places, Anatolia, and the flower has long been prized by the Ottomans. Planted in formal gardens, the design of which owes much to the Persian “paradise garden”, they are a spectacular display of shapes and colour. The layout of the gardens is intended to reflect the layout of paradise, and perfect blooms are a part of that.\n\nDespite the insane financial speculation of “tulip mania” in Holland during the 17th Century, the tulip was not a native plant; it had arrived from the Ottoman Empire. The Dutch, however, were quite innovative when they indulged in the lunacy of tulip speculation, trading individual bulbs at ridiculously inflated prices. They even operated a “tulip futures” market on specimens that hadn’t even been planted or grown! Dishonesty was rife and eventually the speculation had to stop; the tulip market collapsed, like all financial bubbles, leaving many penniless. The tulip, fortunately, remains a popular garden plant to this day, although thankfully without the financial jiggery-pokery! Gardeners with too much money did pay high prices for tulip bulbs in the 18th Century although these were for planting, not financial speculation.</long_description>

<short_description>A great arsenal is a government-owned factory, intended to manage the manufacturing and development of long guns and all the paraphernalia needed. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe development of new cannons is an expensive and sometimes risky business, and one that the state likes to keep under its immediate control. No government likes to contemplate rebellion, but central control of heavy artillery and its production is a wise policy. Rebels without cannons are an annoyance: with large guns, rebels can become revolutionaries!\n\nLarge guns are necessary for armies (and navies, for that matter) to operate effectively. The ability of a nation to project its power in war is, in large part, measured by the size and variety of its artillery train.\n\nHistorically, the arsenals of many states were peacetime stores for cannons, shot and powder; domestic peacekeeping by an army rarely required artillery. Once cast, a cannon barrel could spend decades in storage before being mounted on a carriage and used in anger. Gunpowder, too, could spend neglected years in storage, and this caused all kinds of problems when it was finally issued to gunners. Money for the upkeep of stores also caused problems, too often ending up in the pockets of the Masters of Ordnance and his friends!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nSome objects in the collection are the spoils of war, gifts from travellers, the items collected on the whims of past rulers, and intriguing curios from around the world. This is, in many ways, the national equivalent of a savant’s “cabinet of curiosities”: a miscellany of interesting things, collected simply because they were interesting. The other half of the collection is a clear demonstration of national prowess in all fields, be that a piece of intricate machinery, a work of superlative craftsmanship, the largest cannon in the world, and so on. It is understandable if a certain chauvinism creeps into the enterprise: it is an exercise in national trumpet-blowing!\n\nHistorically, private museums and displays had developed from the collections in “cabinets of curiosities”, and some of these had ended up as government or royal property. The world-famous British Museum began in just this way, when Sir Hans Sloane’s collection was left to George II so that it could be preserved for the nation. Now a wonderful collection of antiquities, the Museum was intended to be a universal collection, and had natural history, geology, and science exhibits.</long_description>

<key>gunnery_school_european</key>
<short_description>A practical education in the arts of gunnery and the uses of firepower can be a very useful thing for an officer of artillery.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGunners see themselves as a “race apart” from army officers, and with good reason. They are skilled specialists who have spent years studying their trade. In the wrong hands, cannons can be as dangerous to their users as to the enemy, so gunners are actually expected to know what they are about. Unlike army officers, who have often obtained their rank through the purchase of a commission, gunners are promoted on seniority and merit. It is not enough to stand around looking brave; a gunner needs to understand military surveying and drawing, mathematics, ballistics, some military engineering, and have a grasp of technical matters. This can create tensions between “gentlemen” officers and the gunners practicing “a trade”.\n\nHistorically, many corps of artillery and gunnery schools are older than national standing armies, as they can date their foundations back to the times when a Master of Ordnance or Artillery was part of a royal household. The most famous artillery student is, of course, Napoleon Bonaparte; his interest was considered surprising given his background as a member of the minor nobility.</long_description>

<short_description>A palace that is almost beyond magnificent, intended to be the envy and amazement of the world. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAll palaces are intended to overawe and intimidate those who seek an audience. The scale of everything is monumental and slightly inhuman, providing the ultimate stage for the public exercise of absolute power. This palace is the external realisation in marble and gold of the fundamental truth that here is a sovereign lord who has no limits: nothing is beyond his ambition. The entire resources of a state can be spent to create such a palace, if desired; if it costs a thousand lives, no matter. Within the walls, the palace is a world within a world, where official perquisites are jealously guarded and fought over, even as the officials scurry to carry out their master’s every wish.\n\nHistorically, buildings such as the Winter Palace in St Petersburg, Russia, and the High Porte, the private court of the Ottoman Sultans, were almost small towns in themselves. Their grandeur still inspires admiration and amazement, even today. From the Tsar and the Sultan downward, there was a strict hierarchy with everyone plotting and counter-plotting to keep or gain status. Even the servants “below stairs” had their own pecking order.</long_description>

<short_description>The seat of government in a constitutional monarchy, as the monarch has become a ceremonial figurehead with deliberately limited powers.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nParliamentary government involves the elected representatives of the people forming a government with the monarch’s consent – although the ministers who emerge from the system may not be entirely to the monarch’s taste! While the sovereign can at least have an advisory role, and choose chief ministers, those ministers determine national policy. Unless a ministry can command majority support in parliament, its policies, of left or right, radical or conservative, will fail.\n\nThe terms “left” and “right” to define political views in an elected system come from just before the violent birth of the French Republic, when the absolutist Louis XVI was moving towards a constitutional monarchy. The liberal deputies of the “Third Estate” in the “Estates General” (a parliament called by Louis) sat to the left of the assembly president’s chair, while the nobility (the “Second Estate”) with more conservative views sat on his right. The terms “left” and “right” have continued to this day, usually in a disapproving fashion. Louis’ success with his constitutional experiments was limited: the guillotine ended his reign in a sudden and cravat-ruining fashion!</long_description>

<short_description>The palace of a republic’s president, the people’s most exalted servant, is the expression of a nation’s dignity in stone. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe president is expected to live in some style, yet retain his accessibility as the elected leader. Like many royal palaces, a president’s home is home to a working bureaucracy, keeping the affairs of the nation in order. \n\nRepublics often hark back to the Classical themes of their culture: European republics hark back to Roman architecture for its grandeur, monumental scale and implied permanence. Other cultures have a similar tendency to appropriate the dignity of the past for their political buildings. \n\nHistorically, and despite many egalitarian protests, most presidential residences are palatial in luxury if not in size. Most presidents are from the moneyed classes, after all, and are used to their creature comforts. Of course, a republic does not imply any kind of equality, merely that “the people” have the greatest say in government; the ruling classes still exist and still expect their perquisites. Purpose-built presidential palaces are usually grander, as an exercise in overawing visiting foreign dignitaries with the power and prestige of the nation itself and the office of president (if not always the prestige of the current holder of the office).</long_description>

<short_description>Mining is only part of the process of extracting wealth from the ground. Once on the surface, the ore must be processed and smelted. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nFor a mine owner to gain the maximum profit from his investment, as much usable material as possible must be extracted from the ore. This means that a large number of processes must be carried out on an industrial scale: the ore will need to be washed, sorted by hand to extract worthless spoil, crushed, and finally smelted and ingots cast. All of these tasks need a large number of workers, and women and children do the work while their men labour in the depths. Even away from the shafts, the work is dangerous and deaths and injuries are not uncommon. It is also unhealthy work too: dust is ever present, and the fumes from smelting works are often poisonous. \n\nA large mine workings poisons the land and water for miles around, and turns pleasant countryside into a wasteland of spoil heaps and toxic ponds. This does not matter, as long as profit continues.</long_description>

<short_description>The earth has many hidden treasures: all a man need do is scratch its surface and he will be rewarded.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nExtracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.\n\nIt is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it.</long_description>

<short_description>Blacksmiths are the heart of many communities. Their skills make tools for the farm, the home and the workshop alike. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSmiths make everything that the world of work uses, from ploughshares, horseshoes and sickles to knives, nails, and wagon tyres. They even make the machinery to make more machines, as they make tools for themselves and other crafts not to mention the working parts of many workshops. The number of people with the surname “Smith” (or its equivalent) shows the historical importance of ironworking!\n\nThe job is, however, dirty and dangerous. Fire is an ever-present danger, and working with red hot metal has risks all of its own. It breeds tough, hardy, independent men with an unsentimental eye for profit. \n\nMaking iron requires a great deal of charcoal as fuel. This means that the secondary industry of charcoal burning uses large tracts of woodland to make charcoal, and is one of the main limitations on iron production. It is almost impossible to produce enough charcoal, year after year, to keep the furnaces burning because managed woodlands don’t grow fast enough.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA workshop is a vital resource for the community, whatever it produces. These small-scale industries have a large role to play in the tribe’s prosperity and survival.\n\nBeads, for example, were an important craft product in Native American society. They were used in ceremonial jewellery and clothing and as a form of currency where barter was not used. Despite the large number of people involved in craftwork, the tribes never used anything more powerful than human muscle in their industries.</long_description>

<key>ironmasters_works_european</key>
<short_description>Hot, mortally dangerous, clamorous and filthy, the forges and works of the ironmasters are, for some, a presentment of Hell on Earth.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBlacksmiths can only produce small quantities of good quality iron, and small items, thanks to their reliance on muscle power for all work. The ironmasters have the financial backing and imagination to scale up the production of iron, and use water power to force air into the furnaces and power machines to work the metal. Where there is a plentiful supply of coal, water and ore, the ironmasters can make a profit.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and the modern world we now live in owe their existence to one small valley in Shropshire, England. Coalbrookdale had good supplies of water and coal and this encouraged Abraham Darby to establish his coke-burning foundry there to make iron (there had been foundries in Coalbrookdale before, producing cannon shot among other things). Charcoal-powered furnaces were becoming uneconomic, as the demand for wood outstripped supply, hence the switch to coal and coke. Darby’s methods were revolutionary and the family business went from strength to strength. The production of high-quality iron generated demand for more; the Iron Bridge at Ironbridge, for example, demonstrated that iron was a superb construction material, thanks to the efforts of Abraham’s grandson, also called Abraham.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nOriginally formed as the Church’s “shock troops” of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuits have long used education as a weapon in their struggle against Protestant heresy. Their colleges give Catholic students an excellent grounding in many disciplines, as well as making sure that their faith is certain and sure. A few pupils receive scholarships or charity, but the majority of them are the children of the social elites in Catholic nations. Jesuit Colleges have an essentially conservative bent, and exist to confirm the existing political and social order (and the Church’s over-arching authority) in the minds of the students, not make them question the world.\n\nThe Society of Jesus has a long tradition of intellectual excellence, a legacy of its duty to debate with Protestant reformers of the Church. Many of the Vatican’s best scientists and thinkers have been found among its ranks. The Jesuits also have a long tradition of educating the laity, and still provide a secular and religious education that is the equal of any other in the world.</long_description>

<key>kilns_european</key>
<short_description>Industrial-sized kilns are large ovens for firing hundreds of pottery items in a single batch. The scale of the enterprise demands an end to craft-based production. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWith a move to large kilns, unskilled work supplements the craft skills of a potter. Each individual worker masters one skill, such as sticking on handles, using a plate mould, or glazing pottery. This type of working is an early form of the division of labour, allowing faster production with a relatively unskilled (and therefore cheaper) workforce. Pottery at an industrial kiln is still a batch-production process, although the kilns are so large that they can take a week to fill with wares before firing, and at least as long to cool down again afterwards. Factory owners are under no obligation to let the kilns cool before expecting workers to enter and empty them.\n\nHistorically, as large-scale production of pottery got underway in the English Midlands by Josiah Wedgewood and others, better transport links followed: there was little point in making fine china if it was going to be smashed to pieces in a cart! Wedgewood’s need to reach markets partly fed into a wave of canal construction, which in turn allowed exploitation of distant resources, thereby creating a virtuous circle of prosperity.</long_description>

<key>large_coffee_plantation_european</key>
<short_description>Plantations are a very successful method of growing cash crops to meet demand in the home market. For the owner, a large plantation is a prestigious investment. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe profits, however, can be substantial, and this wealth is often reinvested in recreating an upper-crust lifestyle for the plantation’s owning family. This is true even in republics: egalitarianism only extends so far, and rarely includes the field hands doing the back-breaking labour! Owners behave with staggering levels of brutality towards their workers, regardless of whether or not they are formally slaves. Partly, of course, it is fear that leads them to behave this way: the workers outnumber the overseers many times over. \n\nA large plantation is also an island of home luxuries in an alien land. Owners have money to import anything and everything from home, and some take the opportunity to behave like kings in their own tiny empires. They are the propertied classes, the ones with influence, and few people at home really care about their methods.</long_description>

Mostly these are collections of one-off and limited edition books, produced by scribes: rare, difficult to collect and very expensive.  \n\nThe arrival of accessible libraries is a direct result of the printing press. As soon as it became possible to print thousands of copies of a book, it was possible to create a relatively cheap and replaceable collection of books. \n\nLibraries rarely allow just anyone access. A subscription usually limits access to, in effect, the moneyed and propertied classes. There is, however, a “trickle down” effect as the autodidacts and dilettantes rarely resist passing on their new knowledge to others! While learning increases this is not without its risks to those in power: it is a series of short steps from reading to questioning matters than should not be questioned. Secondly, there is the risk that the reading public might have access to any kind of nonsensical revolutionary, heretical or just lewd rubbish! Think of the damage that could be done to vulnerable souls if a gentleman’s wife or servants were to get hold of such books!</long_description>

<short_description>No one can afford to ignore a plentiful, cheap source of food. Inshore fishing can bring in good catches.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA local fishery, however, only takes fish from the waters nearby, and most fishermen use small work boats, thus limiting the overall size of the catch. There is always a surplus that can be sent inland to supplement local food supplies. While catches can be seasonal as the fish come and go according to the tides and currents, it is rare for the catch to fail completely. Fishing is a dangerous activity: each year the sea claims its share of the fishing fleet and the lives of many men.\n\nHistorically, fish was an important food staple all around the world. There were religious prescriptions that encouraged the eating of fish such as the Catholic requirement not to eat flesh on a Friday. Islamic jurisprudence sees fish with scales as halal (permissible), while some authorities hold that shelled sea creatures are haraam (forbidden). Given the bottom-dwelling nature of mussels, clams, and so on and the inherent risk of food poisoning if they are improperly stored or cooked, this is a sensible precaution.</long_description>

Ice fishing in winter is a cold, lonely and slow business compared to using nets and lures in spring. The arrival of fish off the coast and in rivers is also tied to the passing seasons.\n\nFish often play a key part in mythology, none more than the salmon. One tale tells of a salmon becoming involved in a contest for a chief’s daughter. The contest saw the salmon break a set of elk antlers into pieces to win the hand of the young maiden.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThese schools are often attached to mosques, but they do not offer religious instruction alone. Those who wish to do so may study the Qur’an, and become honoured as a “hafiz” when they have memorised the whole text. Others may choose a wider syllabus and learn additional subjects such as history, logic, shari’ah law, the Hadith – the recorded sayings and deeds of the Prophet, peace be upon him – and correct interpretation of the Qur’an. Those who finish their studies will gain status as scholars and imams, and become leaders in the wider community expected to interpret the law and religion for their fellow Muslims.\nHistorically, some madrassas offered their pupils an even wider choice of subjects, including Arabic literature, English, French, Dutch and other useful trade languages as well as science, mathematics and world history. The scholars produced were intellectually rounded individuals, often better prepared for later studies than the counterparts in Europe. There were even madrassas that specialised as medical schools.</long_description>

Appointed as a judge for his local standing, the magistrate of a region often acts as an administrator, tax collector, thief-taker, leader in charitable good works, military recruiter and father figure to his community. A magistrate usually represents both the state and the landed classes. It is his task, as often as not, to protect the rights of property rather than of people, even when a republican regime is in power – liberty and equality are all very well, but the deserving rich need to be sure their wealth is safe!\n\nMagistrates also often have the power to raise troops as formed units, and to send convicted men into the military as a punishment. The magistrate, therefore, becomes the first line of defence against the mob in times of disorder.</long_description>

<short_description>The zamindar is an overseer of taxes. His word is more than law for the peasants: it can be life and death if he chooses to take all of their surplus crop and more.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe land-holding system of the zamindar (the word comes from the Persian for “landholder”) outwardly has much in common with feudal systems common in Europe and Japan. Land tenure is given to office holders and nobles. However, as an overseer of taxes a zamindar only holds his lands as long as he pays the stipulated revenue to the central government. He is, in effect, a tax farmer: his income and profit are dependent solely on his ability to tax his lands. He also carries out judicial and military duties for his tenured lands.\n\nHistorically, the zamindari system survived both the end of Muhgal rule and the British Raj. Tax farming allowed the European trading companies to take over as zamindars themselves (and make a profit), even before the Muhgal collapse, as they could pay governments for the right to collect taxes.</long_description>

Apart from the craftsmen directly involved in ship and boat building, chandlers, net weavers, and the like, there are also smokehouse operators, coopers, salt merchants, shippers – and, in some parts of the world, the inevitable press gangs looking for experienced sailors.\n\nHistorically, hunting the largest “fish” of all – whales – was extremely profitable and, depending on the species, highly dangerous. Whalers used hand-thrown harpoons, often from large rowing boats launched from a mother ship. A wounded whale could easily destroy its hunters’ flimsy craft. Again depending on the type, whales were taken for their meat, whalebone (baleen, the “comb” used to filter out plankton when feeding) and their blubber, which was rendered down into whale oil (actually a kind of runny wax) used in lighting, cosmetics and industry.</long_description>

<short_description>A military academy is a training establishment for young officers, those who must rely on talent, rather than connections or wealth, for preferment.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn most countries, military command is limited to those in the ruling classes. There is a quite sensible belief that only those with a stake in the survival of society will defend it properly. However, there are counter-arguments to the effect that military matters are complicated, and “gentleman amateurs”, no matter how well connected, are not good enough. Military academies, therefore, teach the theory and practice of the military sciences. The graduates, however, are sometimes regarded as common tradesmen because of their knowledge.\n\nThe French were the pre-eminent military power of Western Europe, and lead the way in military teaching with the creation of a “École Militaire” in 1751 to educate promising cadets from poorer backgrounds. It was later re-organised and re-named as the “École des Cadets-gentilshommes” or “School of Young Gentlemen” which subverted the original intent, although Napoleon Bonaparte was a graduate of the new school. By contrast, the United Kingdom’s military schools mostly provided an education for the orphans of serving officers, with no more than the hope that the pupils would go into the army. The Ottoman military system included the Janissaries, a class of warrior-administrators, selected and indoctrinated as children, who effectively ran the Ottoman Empire.</long_description>

<short_description>The practice of billeting troops in a town disperses the men to many households, bringing them together for regular drill and roll calls. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs a way of cheaply housing soldiers, billets seem ideal to many European governments: soldiers are assigned to houses in a local town and the householders are expected to look after them. There is no need to build anything, only the expense of compensating the locals! Other ranks are allocated to the hovels of the lower orders; officers are generally billeted with the local “professional” class such as clergy, doctors and lawyers. With luck, an officer can expect to have a comfortable, even luxurious, place to stay. \n\nThe English term “billet” is the French word for “ticket”, this being the promissory note given to householders to pay for the soldiers’ food and drink during their stay, not the actual building itself. \n\nHistorically, the billeting of troops in civilian houses was not without its problems. Dispersing men across a town was not a good way to maintain discipline, particularly as the subsistence allowance often went on drink – hardly surprising given that the places best able to cope with boisterous men were often public houses. Soldiers and drink rarely mix to good effect. Local grumbling and disloyalty could encourage men to desert when away from their officers.</long_description>

<short_description>These barracks are as much prison as military establishment, often intended to keep unwilling recruits under lock and key until they can be despatched to an army in the field. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLevying men for an army is a form of taxation-in-kind, men doing service under a variety of feudal-style laws and customs. It is enough to have a strong back; wits are not required in a levied soldier. Once taken from the field or workshop, a levy receives rudimentary training and shambles off to fight for the state. It is important to segregate him from the civilian population, particularly family and friends, hence the need for secure barracks. Once a levy has been sent to another province the risk of him running drops dramatically, of course – there’s nowhere to go. \n\nFor many governments, a barracks is also a reminder to the population that the gun and the sabre back the edicts of the civil government in an area. \n\nHistorically, levies were always the last in an army to receive anything, from pay, food and new weapons to accommodations. Their barracks were fetid, disgusting places, barely suitable for keeping farmyard animals, let alone large numbers of men.</long_description>

<short_description>A formal training area for tribal warriors to perfect battle skills and learn necessary discipline. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nProtecting family and land is the first responsibility for a young warrior. Learning weapon skills during the hunt gives a man the skills of a fighter; learning to fight alongside others makes him a useful warrior, and a credit to his tribe. \n\nHistorically, warriors used the bow and arrow with astounding skill, thanks to constant hunting. Other daily tools such as the hatchet-like tomahawk were useful in war too. Oddly, in some tribes it was the custom to bury tomahawks once a war was ended (hence “bury the hatchet”). The tribes, however, never developed an organised approach to warfare to match that of the European invaders.</long_description>

<short_description>A military hospital cares for the chronically sick, the wounded, and for aged veterans. Any soldier who finds a bed here is fortunate. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMany military hospitals are not purely medical or surgical facilities, but charitable institutions. Their purpose is to look after old and infirm veterans who will otherwise starve after leaving the colours. Old age pensions and veterans’ benefits are an exception rather than the norm, and poor laws exist to keep the poor out of sight rather than to alleviate their poverty. Military hospitals also provide a convenient source of experienced, if somewhat lame, recruits for many governments – reliable men for garrison duty.\n\nThe 18th Century was not a time to be sick, old and poor and, in many countries, propertied individuals recognised this unfortunate fact. Some colonels did look after their own men, sometimes. John Manners, the Marquis of Granby (1721-1770), for example, had the rather splendid habit of giving his non-commissioned officers enough money to buy taverns at the end of their military service, which explains why England (still) has so many public houses named “The Marquis of Granby”! He is also reputedly the source of the remark “to go at someone bald-headed”, a result of losing his wig during a cavalry charge at Warburg in 1760, and gave the British Army its GRANBY codename for the 1991 Gulf War.</long_description>

<short_description>A military hospital cares for the wounded and long-term sick. Any soldier who finds a bed here is fortunate. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIslamic and Indian medical doctors are among the best available and can draw on a long medical tradition when treating patients, often with more success than is found in using much-trumpeted “scientific” European methods. Unfortunately, they need all these skills against the many deadly diseases that are endemic to their homelands: malaria alone is a terrible problem and can destroy armies even more surely than defeat. On top of disease, the surgical problems of wounded men are compounded by the ever-present risks of gangrene and other infections. Even the simplest wound will quickly fester unless treated promptly and properly, especially in hot climates, and a wise administration makes sure that men have adequate medical facilities to hand.\n\nHistorically, armies in India and the Middle East were subject to terrible attrition thanks to disease, even those composed of natives to the area. Most men in the ranks died not from enemy action, but from a variety of illnesses brought on by poor sanitation, bad diet and poor housing. Invaders suffered even more, lacking as they did any kind of immunity to local endemic diseases.</long_description>

<short_description>A barracks is the basis of power laid bare for all to see and understand: obey, or answer to the governor’s troops and guns.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBarracks provide housing, armouries, and stabling for most types of troops, along with some space for the men to practice necessary military skills. They are usually also designed to be defensible, quite separately from any town walls, as a precaution against any local troubles. To that end, they often have a grim aspect, and dominate towns where they are found. From here, the governor can send men to defend his territory against enemies foreign and domestic, and the guardroom can even double as a prison for particularly troublesome local worthies.\n\nWithout a civilian police force in many countries, 18th Century governments were often forced to use troops for domestic purposes. Suppressing riots, keeping order and thief-taking were only part of their civilian support tasks. Soldiers would also be used to protect the property of the wealthy and, more importantly, to protect tax gatherers and their takings. This made soldiers a group apart from civilian society. Their popularity and acceptability were directly related their use against civilians, and the perceived threats from foreign nations.</long_description>

<short_description>A military governor rules by “the rod and the axe”, and the highly visible presence of his soldiers helps him keep order.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile having soldiers to hand is clearly useful, it is equally important to keep them away from civilians except in an official capacity. By keeping the men in an encampment rather than quartering them in people’s homes they can be kept from fraternizing too much with the locals. They have no chance to develop any unfortunate sympathies that will keep them from enforcing the governor’s orders without hesitation. It is, of course, impossible to keep soldiers away from all their comforts, but contacts can be limited.\n\nHistorically, most “encampments” were hardly military in appearance, as most armies needed a huge baggage train of sutlers to provide food and drink, wagon masters for transport, armourers and smiths for weapons and gear, pioneers, priests, hangers-on, hawkers, officers’ servants, and a raggle-taggle of dependents, not to mention wives of both the permanent and just-for-an-hour-or-two kind.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe investigation of the universe, and disputation over the results, are not done out of any sense of altruism, of course. National pride in intellectual achievement is an important motive in the work undertaken. Personal pride and ambition are also stern taskmasters. But what is significant is that the ideas, theories and facts generated at the university are not kept within the academic elite. This flowering of learning informs and inspires artists, poets and musicians, and well-read laymen too. The practical benefits of the advances made here percolate out into the wider national society, improving life for the ordinary people in ways both small and dramatic.\n\nIn the 18th Century great universities and the great minds they attracted were sources of nationalistic pride. Sir Isaac Newton was lauded across Europe for his work at Cambridge in England. The University of Gottingen aided the development of “German-ness” by publishing research and standard texts in German as well as Latin (the traditional language of learning). Gottingen was also unusual in, rather daringly, letting lecturers teach any book without reference to the State or Church!</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe education offered is, of course, heavily weighted towards religious matters. The students will often become priests, so they must understand the creed and doctrine of the Orthodox Church and have the wisdom to act as guides and arbiters in their communities.\n\nHistorically, monasteries were not only retreats from the world, but the places where knowledge was preserved. The scriptoriums and libraries of monasteries kept and copied information from antiquity, while outside their walls life was nasty, brutish and violently short. Orthodox monasteries also had a long tradition of producing and preserving beautiful religious icons, and of performing liturgical music of an amazingly high quality.</long_description>

<short_description>Pioneer cabins are built on land sold to European settlers. The sale provides a cash lump sum, but the Europeans cause unrest by their presence.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nLog cabins provide shelter and safety for pioneers as they migrate to the unexplored west. The pioneers live simple lives on civilization’s frontier, and these dwellings prove more than adequate for survival. However, the sale of land that intrinsically cannot be owned causes unrest amongst the tribal locals, and the gradual encroachment upon their way of life by strange European interlopers is worse. The sales provide funds for the further development of tribal society, but there are many who resent this loss of the old ways.\n\nThe perilous journey of the pioneer was undertaken by those seeking a new life. Upon arrival a suitable site for a cabin was chosen, and the land around would be cleared of vegetation. The cabins were relatively easy to build and used notches to slot the stacked log walls together. They could be insulated against the weather by stuffing the any gaps with sticks, rocks and a coating of mud.</long_description>

<short_description>Farms built on land bought from the natives provide food for the pioneers and money for developing tribal societies, but may be seen as a threat.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nFor pioneers, day-to-day life can be a dangerous struggle. Cut off from outside supplies, not to mention luxuries from established towns, starvation is a constant threat. Farms enable pioneers to control food production and become independent, though many among the tribes are wary of the gradual encroachment of outsiders.\n\nPioneers introduced new farming techniques to the native tribes, advancing existing farming traditions by increasing yields. The planting of the ‘three sisters’ was an important aspect of this tradition, and a major food source for tribes. Squash, maize, and climbing beans were all planted in what is now called a &apos;complimentary planting’ sytem. The maize provided a frame for the beans to climb and the squash, by spreading across the ground, prevented weeds from competing with the food crops.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nPioneers raise cattle and sheep, bringing a trade to their wild frontier by creating valuable sources of food and trade. The tribe sells land and gains capital that way, but the change to ranching destroys the tribe’s peace with the Spirits.\n\nThe Spanish introduced ranching to America. The word comes from the Spanish “rancho” or small farm. Americans first practiced open-range ranching: livestock was allowed to roam freely and was then rounded up. Branding was used to distinguish cattle ownership, but as settlers arrived on the Plains the livestock became a nuisance, leading to rustling and the fencing of ranch land. Ranching eventually spread right across North America, becoming the basis of the “Wild West”.</long_description>

<short_description>Ships at sea are a visible sign of naval power but without organisation, they are worthless. A naval administration keeps the fleets at sea running smoothly.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMore than simply organising supplies, fleet movements, promotions and pay, a naval administration also draws up plans for the future: it oversees construction of new dockyards and shore facilities, husbands scarce resources (some sea-going officers would say a little too carefully), and collects navigation charts and improved ship designs from all over the world. The navy secretariat studies anything worthwhile to make the sea service more effective or (better yet) cheaper!\n\nAs navies increased in size during the 18th Century, the support operations ashore became correspondingly large. The Royal Navy was the largest “business” in the world, employing tens of thousands of workers to produce everything needed for the fleet from ropes to nails, yards to swivel guns. The functionaries needed to oversee this enterprise had to be clever, clear thinking and reasonably honest: a man would give a lucrative contract to friends, if he could, but not if it risked the good of the Service. Other nations never really matched the efficiency of the British Royal Navy system, and their fleets at sea suffered as a result.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe college exists to provide the practical mathematics needed for safe navigation, a theoretical understanding of the mysteries of ship handling (a complex subject, given the rigging of most ships), gunnery, swordsmanship, the manners of gentlemen, some Classics, perhaps a foreign language, and the laws and usages of war. The final product is a junior officer who is presentable, but not necessarily entirely useful aboard a ship! A stupid or ill-prepared man could sink his ship and kill his crew as surely as any enemy, and to master their chosen profession newly-minted officers must go to sea.\n\nIn the 18th Century, virtually every navy recognised the need for professional naval officers. While men who had nothing more to offer than good breeding could do a fine job in command of armies, ships’ captains really needed to know their jobs, otherwise their careers really would end on the rocks! The better navies of the time operated as a “moderated meritocracy” – influence and connections still counted, but ability, training and character counted for more.</long_description>

<short_description>A naval hospital gives high quality cares to the sick and wounded. A sailor who finds himself looked after here can count himself lucky!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe navy pays for doctors and surgeons to cure his infirmities; he has a bed in a clean ward; and best of all, he cannot spend his pay on drink and loose living. From the navy’s point of view, their men are returned to duty quickly and cannot desert or be “crimped” (pressed into service) by unscrupulous carers.\n\nHistorically, illness aboard ship could be a serious problem: “ship fever” (typhus) could destroy a crew more surely than a battle. It was traditional to put the sick ashore and leave them in the dubious care of lodging house and tavern owners. Death was the most likely outcome for the patient. The British Royal Navy constructed hospitals ashore to look after their sick and wounded; skilled seamen, it has to be said, were not easy to find, and taking good care of them made excellent sense. Better health care for sailors also came in small matters, such as the Royal Navy’s “portable soup”, a kind of dried beef stock that made a hot meal with the addition of hot water and a few vegetables. Good food aboard ship was as important as good doctoring ashore.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis is simply an open pit – the word quarry is hardly appropriate, as that would imply some sort of organisation – where workers scrabble in the mud to find gemstones. As miners are only paid for what they find, it is possible for men to work for days or weeks shifting mud and rock without seeing a single penny. The prospect of finding that one, valuable strike is enough to keep them going, even when the risk of the pit collapsing is great.\n\nOthers work the spoil heaps, searching for valuable stones that have been thrown aside in the rush to delve into the earth. What with the diggings, the shantytown that surrounds the workings, and the spoil heaps, an open pit is an eyesore. It is also some of the most valuable real estate in the world.</long_description>

<short_description>The earth has many hidden treasures: all a man need do is scratch its surface and he will be rewarded.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nExtracting precious ores from the earth is back breaking and dangerous work but also infinitely rewarding. In these times of trade with far away nations, a man can make a considerable living out of the earth and its bounty. Precious metals and stones can be traded in their raw state or used to make trade items such as jewelry or weapons.\n\nIt is thought that Native American tribes were mining as long ago as 900 AD. Grooved axes, mauls and anvils have been discovered dating back to this period showing that not only did the tribes know how to extract metal but also how to work it.</long_description>

<short_description>An opera house is a sumptuous theatre for the performance of highly stylized musical plays. Society figures attend to be seen rather than for amusement.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nNo expense is spared on making an opera house a grand venue. An opera house rivals many great palaces with the luxury of its fixtures and fittings, as these public areas for the audience are more important than the entertainment. Theatrical contrivances and mechanical tricks may make the staging as grand as the music, but for the elite it is the gossip, plotting and backbiting that is the real pleasure of a night at the opera.\n\nIn the 18th Century opera was done in the Italian “serious” style, a musical form that influenced many non-Italian composers including Mozart. The plots were intentionally simple, based on Classical themes, usually tragic and often had a highly conservative bent – as befitted the tastes of the patrons paying for the music. Many are still performed today. One fashion that has (mercifully) ended is the use of castrati singers: young men gelded so that their voices did not break and remained in the soprano range.</long_description>

<short_description>There are rich traditions in the Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic arts that are valued by the educated and wealthy. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIndia is the birthplace of many cultures and arts, and the ruling classes have enough money to demand – and pay for – the best of everything. This creates a demand for skilled artisans of many kinds, and a demand for training in the arts from rich dilettantes who wish to dabble for themselves and, after all, an educated patron can spend his money wisely. There are schools specialising in every art, from erotic temple statuary to manuscript illumination – and everything in between.\n\nHistorically, some of the finest buildings and artistic achievements in India were created during the period of Mughal rule, in a style that can be called Islamo-Indian. The Islamic Mughal ruling class appreciated the skills of their Hindu subjects, and made full use of them in creating a rich and beautiful environment. At places like Lahore Fort, later rulers continued the tradition of architectural and artistic excellence.</long_description>

<short_description>Poetry is a form of literature held in high regard throughout the Turkish, Persian and Arab-speaking world by all the educated classes of society.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe styles and hidden allegorical meanings of poems take much time to master, and there is a rich set of traditions to draw on from all three languages.\n\nOttoman “divan” poetry uses Persian forms and many borrowed words (as Turkish does not suit Persian rhyming schemes). Arab poetry can be a great many styles, some of which need careful handling if they are not to offend religious sensibilities. Poetry can distract from proper Islamic studies, as well as praise God. A school of poetry teaches all of these nuances, and provides a grounding for those who wish to become court poets, a rewarding position for those who have talent.\n\nFinding a patron is, of course, a matter for the individual students, and a good grasp of calligraphic styles can help too. Being literate and having a beautiful style of penmanship is truly something to be treasured.</long_description>

<short_description>A sacred site where a tribe can honour its fallen warriors for all time.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.\n\nBurial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on.</long_description>

<short_description>This council of state is charged with looking after all matters relating to the production and use of artillery.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe committee is in charge of the design, development, casting and storage of artillery pieces for all the armed forces. The members are also in charge of powder production for the army and navy too, all too often with the bureaucratic muddle and rivalry that this can cause. The Ordnance is an important national asset because artillery is very expensive and yet a measure of national power.\n\nHistorically, great guns and siege weapons always required specialists to operate them, men quite separate from common soldiery. In charge was a Master of Ordnance, a man of some importance in medieval royal households. His duties of looking after the king’s artillery train eventually required a large staff of gunners, founders, powder makers, mathematicians, surveyors and even wagon drivers. In time, all of these men came under the control of the Board or Council of Ordnance, depending on the state involved, and they extended their responsibilities to take in the management of fortresses and, in some cases, the manufacture of all weapons for the army and navy.</long_description>

<key>ordnance_factory_european</key>
<short_description>An ordnance factory is a large-scale enterprise dedicated to the design and manufacture of guns and their associated equipment for the army and navy. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe large-scale manufacturing of cannons is a monopoly often retained by the state, even in a republic: there is no need for anyone other than a government to own large cannons! The creation of large guns is also a difficult and expensive business, and the state is the only authority that can afford to do it. The number of guns available is therefore a measure of national prestige, and the ability to produce guns (rather than buy them from foreigners) is equally prestigious. An ordnance factory adds lustre and firepower to armies.\n\nHistorically, most ordnance factories began as royal establishments, giving the crown in each nation a source of cannons. These were needed for reducing the castles of recalcitrant barons! Even though politics moved on, the state control of cannon production remained. The royal household or near-ministerial status of the Master Gunner or Master of the Ordnance is proof that artillery was an important part of national or royal prestige. Size really did matter! The Ottoman Turks had a strong tradition of artillery production, in particular heavy siege guns.</long_description>

<key>pleasure_gardens_european</key>
<short_description>An ornamental garden, laid out in a formal style with pleasant walks to show off horticultural wonders and the fashionable elements of society equally.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nPublic gardens are for the enjoyment of the leisured classes, and this usually means the moneyed classes. The chance to wander through a carefully tended landscape, enjoy a rural idyll and, possibly, a fashionable “pique-nique” while being seen by one’s peers is definitely a pleasure of the rich.\n\nHistorically, pleasure gardens often catered to a wide clientele, not all of whom came to enjoy the flowers. Visitors who stayed after dark could enjoy entertainments of a very non-horticultural, though similarly earthy, nature. The character of the gardens changed as night fell: they became the haunt of prostitutes, gamblers, mollies and the foully debauched. Vauxhall Gardens in London, for example, were notorious as playgrounds of vice and disgusting iniquity, where a meal, a whore (of any kind) and a drunken evening of sin were available to anyone with sufficient funds, if they could avoid a mugging. The elaborate theatricals and fireworks staged at Vauxhall were merely a bonus for watching revellers!</long_description>

<short_description>Gardens have long been valued for their tranquillity and ordering of the natural world: a place to rest and restore the spirits.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThese gardens are often part of palace grounds, but open to the more important members of society so that they can marvel at the opulent riches and good taste of their rulers. The plantings are restrained and carefully managed: these are not gardens that reflect the wildness of nature, but places that show man’s mastery over the natural world. Geometry is as important as horticulture in the layout of paths, fountains, watercourses and planting beds.\n\nHistorically, formal gardens were a feature of many palaces in the Middle East and India, where collections of rare and exotic blooms could be displayed. Formal water gardens of enormous size were laid out, where rulers and their courtiers could take their ease and enjoy the cooler air in the shade of carefully tended trees. In particular, the extravagant use of water in a desert was the mark of limitless wealth.</long_description>

<key>pottery_workshops_european</key>
<short_description>Pottery workshops are a “cottage industry” enterprise, where each potter carries out all the manufacturing process rather than splitting the work between specialists. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA pottery workshop needs only a supply of clay – something that can be found almost anywhere in the world – and charcoal for the kiln, and the charcoal is optional if unfired “greenware” is being made. Most pottery produced is earthenware. Even with a highly skilled potter, there is a limit to how much can be produced. Pottery is a batch-production process, and the rate of production is limited by the size of the potter’s kiln and the time needed for the kiln to cool safely after firing a batch. That said, if an entire community is engaged in the trade, it is possible to make significant numbers of small batches.\n\nPottery was one of the earliest types of human manufactured items. The process of making ceramics barely changed in hundreds of years: an 18th Century potter would have had no trouble working in a Roman or Ancient Egyptian pottery works, for example.  Many local styles evolved over time, partly thanks to the difficulty of moving (relatively fragile) goods any distance by land.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nA workshop is a vital resource for the community, whatever it produces. These small-scale industries have a large role to play in the tribe’s prosperity and survival.\n\nBeads, for example, were an important craft product in Native American society. They were used in ceremonial jewellery and clothing and as a form of currency where barter was not used. Despite the large number of people involved in craftwork, the tribes never used anything more powerful than human muscle in their industries.</long_description>

<short_description>The Albertina is a collection of antiquities and objects that are the glory of Vienna.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOriginally constructed as a palace by Count Emanuel Teles Silva-Tarouca on top of one of Vienna’s bastions, the count must have used his influence as master of the Court Construction Office, otherwise the defences might have been left in place. The building subsequently came into the possession of Duke Albert of Saxen-Teschen, the former governor of the Netherlands. He brought his extensive collection of artwork and antiquities back to Vienna from Brussels, and had the palace extended to hold them all.\n\nIn 1776 the collection was expanded when the Austrian ambassador in Venice, Giacomo Durazzo, gave around 1000 artworks to Duke Albert, so that they would have a safe home. The Albertina, as the collection and palace became known, survived even the collapse of Hapsburg power in 1918 at the end of the Great War, and the bombing of Vienna in the Second World War. It remains one of Europe’s great art museums.</long_description>

<short_description>This magnificent palace is a suitably grand and imposing surroundings for the business of running an Empire.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Hofburg was the imperial residence of the Hapsburgs in Vienna, with sections dating back to the Middle Ages. The idea of this being a single palace is something of a mistake, as it is a complex of buildings that has grown up over the centuries as the needs (not to mention rivalries and dislikes) of the Hapsburg rulers have changed. It housed chapels, a music school, and numerous smaller residences for cadet branches of the family. Indeed, there is a complete second palace in the Imperial Stables, a result of a falling out between the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and his son, the Crown Prince Maximilian. Relations between the two were so bad that the Emperor did not want his son under the same roof!\n\nOver the centuries the Hofburg has been extensively rebuilt and remodelled as funds have been available and tastes have changed. It remains, however, a serious expression of Imperial power and grandeur. The building is still in use today as the official residence of the Austrian president.</long_description>

<short_description>The British Museum is a collection of curiosities, antiquities and books that is the envy of the civilized world.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMany 18th Century gentleman collectors exhibited a “cabinet of curiosities” to friends and rivals. Competition for the most noteworthy and prestigious items soon meant that “cabinets” were often whole rooms or suites set aside for this expensive hobby. Studying the curiosities themselves also became a respectable field of scholarly endeavour by antiquarians, a strange collection themselves of dusty, rum coves with limited social skills.\n\nThe British Museum began as one of these collections, but George II donated the Old Royal Library, thus guaranteeing that every book ever published in Britain would end up on its library shelves. Further equally generous gifts, such as Garrick’s library of plays, and shrewd purchases made sure that the collection of antiquities grew at a prodigious rate. Sir William Hamilton (the husband of Emma Hamilton, the mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson) profited quite handsomely when he sold his collection of Roman and Greek items to the Museum. He had collected them, as a hobby, for next to nothing while the ambassador in Naples, Italy. It probably took his mind off being cuckolded.\n\nThe Museum also became home to spoils of exploration and conquest: objects collected during Captain Cook’s expedition to the South Seas were exhibited at the museum for a time. The Rosetta stone also ended up in the Museum, having been captured from the French after Napoleon’s abortive attempt to conquer Egypt.</long_description>

<key>prest_britain_somerset_house</key>
<short_description>This is a national government building, purpose-built to house many of the important departments of state in a suitably awe-inspiring style.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBuilt on the Strand, Somerset House was in a neo-classical style, and was not unusual in having its own water gates and docks in the basement. Eighteenth Century roads were fairly appalling, so the River Thames was the main highway through London and well frequented by government officials. The Thames was also the main sewer for London, which may have made it difficult for casual onlookers to distinguish between politicians and lumps of dung.\n\nWhen Somerset House was designed, it was intended to be a home for most of the government, at least according to the Act of Parliament in 1775 that enabled the work. Among other departments, space was to be available for the Salt Office, the Stamp Office, the Tax Office, the Navy Office (later the Admiralty), the Navy Victualling Office, the Publick Lottery Office, the Hawkers and Pedlar Office, the Hackney Coach Office, the Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, the Auditors of the Imprest Office, the Pipe Office, the Offices of the Duchies of Lancaster and of Cornwall, the Office of the Ordinance, the Bargemaster’s House, and the King’s Barge Houses. Over the next decades, additional building work allowed the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquities to find rooms, not to mention the University of London as some government tenants either moved out or were closed down.</long_description>

<short_description>This is a magnificent and imposing monument to French military prowess and success.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAll armies and nations need to mark their victories and honour their dead. The Arc de Triomphe was the largest structure of its type ever designed, and was intended to be a grandiloquent gesture of French military superiority. This, given that Napoleon Bonaparte had direction of the French army, was entirely reasonable.\n\nCreated to mark Napoleon’s victory at Austerlitz in 1805, the structure was commissioned a year later, but not completed until the 1830s. Napoleon ordered a wooden mock-up to be put in place in 1810, and work was completely halted after the Bourbon restoration. Napoleon’s corpse eventually passed through the arch on its way to its final resting place at Les Invalides. This was not the only remarkable thing to pass through the arch: at the victory parade to mark the end of the First World War, a pilot flew his Nieuport biplane under the arch as part of the event! The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is a later addition, commemorating the honoured dead and missing of the French army in the Great War.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nLawmakers should meet in awe-inspiring and magnificent buildings, because then there is a chance that they will take the business of making new law seriously. If something cannot be built for the purpose, then taking the extremely expensive home of a “dashed aristo” will do quite nicely!\n\nHistorically, the Palais Bourbon was built as a home for Louise-Françoise, duchesse de Bourbon, one Louis XIV’s legitimised bastards by one of his favourite mistresses, Françoise-Athénaïs de Montespan. The building, although rather magnificent and scarcely a hovel, was not technically a palace, because Louise-Françoise herself did not have royal rank. After the French Revolution, it was nationalised and used as a meeting place of the Council of Five Hundred. It is still a parliament building, now acting as home to the deputies of the French National Assembly, the lower legislative house of the French Republic. Louise-Françoise probably wouldn’t recognise her old home, as it has been extensively remodelled.</long_description>

Even a long siege would be a difficult proposition, as the fort is well supplied with water. The fort itself controls the surrounding countryside completely: no foe can move in southern Maharashtra without being observed.\n\nThe fort was taken by Shrimant Shahu Sambhaji Raje Bhonsle Chhatrapati Maharaj (1682-1749), the fourth ruler of the Maratha Empire. Shahu Chhatrapati was a survivor, of both Mughal captivity and a Maratha civil war. He was freed at the end of the War of 27 years (1681-1707) and managed to bring stability and careful expansion to the Marathas. Given that he had spent most of his childhood as an honoured prisoner of the Mughals, his efforts are creditable indeed.</long_description>

<key>prest_maratha_shaniwarwada</key>
<short_description>This magnificent fortified palace is a visible expression of Maratha greatness.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe palace name reflects the auspicious day Shaniwar (Saturday), 10 January 1730 when the foundation stones were placed by the prime minister, Baji Rao, of the Maratha Empire. This wada (or residential complex) was never intended for the king, but to be an official residence for prime ministers and his administration of the Maratha Empire. No expense was spared in its construction: every door in the building was hand-carved from the finest teak; every floor was the finest marble available. The palace took two years to complete, and later prime ministers made it grander still, adding bastions, and magnificent gardens.\n\nWhen designed, the Shaniwar Wada was as much a fortress as palace. An army attempting to breach its gates faced formidable defences.\n\nThe building still exists, although it is much reduced from its former grandeur. A fire in 1828 destroyed much of the original, leaving only the granite structures undamaged.</long_description>

<key>prest_ottomans_naval_engineering_school</key>
<short_description>Despite the name, this naval college offers training to naval architects, shipbuilders and quarterdeck officers.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Naval Engineers’ School began as a training school at the Golden Horn shipyards, and was put on a formal footing by Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha (1713-90), the Grand Vizier of Sultan Mustafa III, and a Franco-Hungarian military adviser, François Baron de Tott. It was a part of Mustafa’s efforts to modernise the Turkish military and naval system in the face of considerable resistance from the janissaries and their leadership. The teaching given was extremely good, and produced fine officers.\n\nHasan Pasha is actually almost more interesting than the school, as he started life as a slave in eastern Turkey and rose through the ranks of the military. He even spent time with the Barbary Pirates of Algiers and, while there, domesticated a lion as a pet! Despite being on the losing side at Battle of Chesma in 1770 his ship, the 84-gun Real Mustafa, was one of the few on the Turkish side to emerge with any credit. His record certainly helped when it came to driving through the (limited) reforms that Mustafa managed to achieve. Baron de Tott’s other achievement was the establishment of a new cannon foundry.</long_description>

<key>prest_ottomans_nur-u_osmaniye_mosque</key>
<short_description>This magnificent Baroque and Rococo mosque is one of the finest religious buildings ever constructed. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is designed in a style that was extremely popular in the Ottoman Empire of the 1700s, and was ordered by Sultan Mahmud I in 1748. Unfortunately for him, it was only completed in the reign of Sultan Osman III in 1755, and is probably the most significant achievement of that particular sultan. The name of the mosque, “Light of Osman” commemorates his efforts in financing this superb, light, airy building with its many windows.\n\nBy most standards (even those of an 18th Century absolute monarch) Osman was a little odd. He was notably intolerant towards non-Muslims and generally regarded as a bit insignificant before he took the throne. He had lived much of his life within the palace as a prisoner. He loathed music, and banished every musician from his court. He also found the company of women extremely distasteful, having been imprisoned within the harem section of the palace. When he became Sultan he took to wearing iron shoes so that his approach would always be audible. Any women in the vicinity were expected to hear him coming, and then find somewhere to hide while he passed by. He was succeeded by Mustafa III, a better fellow and ruler by far.</long_description>

<short_description>This cadet school produces fine officers for the Polish army.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nHistorically, the Akademia, or Szkoła Rycerska, was the Knights’ School or the Nobles’ Academy of Cadets. It was the first state school in Poland, established by King Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the last elected monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1765. King Stanislaw had an abiding belief in the worth of education, both to the individual and the state. Surrounded by enemies, he did his best to advance Polish interests.\n\nOne of the more interesting officer cadets was Tadeusz Kościuszko (1746-1817). Benjamin Franklin recruited him to serve in the Continental Army, and he was appointed as head (military) engineer. His contributions at Ticonderoga and Saratoga, among other occasions, eventually lead to his promotion to brigadier general. He was also given citizenship, land and a large cash grant. To his eternal credit, he used his reward money to help black slaves achieve their freedom. Not satisfied with that, he returned home to Poland and organised a rising against the occupying Russians, although this ended in failure. Tsar Paul I, however, obviously thought him important and influential: in return for an oath of loyalty, 20,000 Polish prisoners of war were freed. Before his death in exile in 1815, Kościuszko had also freed all his serfs in Poland.</long_description>

<key>prest_poland_lazienki_park</key>
<short_description>These magnificent gardens are a splendid setting for any royal palace.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Park and its gardens were acquired by Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last King and Grand Duke of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, after his election. Although already impressive, he set about remodelling them, and made the gardens his life’s work, building his “Palace on the Water” in a suitably magnificent setting by the Lake. This watery connection was how the park got its name of Lazienki or “Royal Baths” Park, after the bathing pavilion that was constructed in the gardens.\n\nThe garden was also a magnificent setting for Stanislaw’s regular dinner parties with leading artists, writers and politicians. While Stanislaw was something of an autocrat, he was also a believer in education and the ideas of the Enlightenment, using the dinners to engage with leading thinkers.\n\nThe park and palaces were lucky to survive the Warsaw Rising in 1944. They were mined for destruction, but the German occupiers never completed their demolition works, although the Lazienki Palace was burned.</long_description>

<short_description>The academy is a gathering of the finest scientific and cultural minds in Germany, uniting science and the humanities in one organisation.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWhile the Academy was a pet project of Prince Frederick III, the Elector of Brandenburg, he did not fund it from royal or state treasuries. Instead, he rather cleverly granted the academy a monopoly on producing and selling calendars in his domain, giving it a steady, but not substantial, income. When Frederick was crowned as “King in Prussia”, the Academy was granted royal patronage.\n\nUnder Frederick the Great, a man normally regarded as a warrior-king, the academy merged with Prussian Nouvelle Société Littéraire (French being a primary language of literature and culture in the 18th Century) and the Royal Academy of Sciences. He also offered cash prizes as incentives to the members to investigate and solve the scientific conundrums of the day. The Academy had its own laboratories, an observatory, libraries, an operating theatre (for public demonstrations of surgery), and gardens for plant specimens.</long_description>

<key>prest_prussia_brandenburg_gate</key>
<short_description>This is a magnificent monument to Prussian military prowess and the peace it obtained.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSited on one of the original city gates of Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate stands at the end of the Unter den Linden, the original approach to the city palace of Frederick II, the King of Prussia. The monumental entrance was always intended to overawe and dwarf anyone going to the palace, making clear Prussian greatness before they had even begun their audience with the monarch.\n\nThe choice of a Classical style was quite deliberate, as it was intended to echo the achievements of Rome and Greece. The decoration of a Quadriga of Victory, or four-horse chariot, is also intended to evoke ancient connotations of triumph, specifically the quadriga from the Hippodrome of Constantinople. It was definitely a symbol of peace through strength, which is almost certainly one of the reasons that it was looted and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1806 after his victory at Jena-Auerstedt. The quadriga was returned in 1814, when Napoleon went into exile on Elba, and given the Iron Cross symbol that it currently carries. Subsequently, the Brandenburg Gate managed to survive two World Wars and the Cold War in a relatively undamaged state.</long_description>

<key>prest_russia_kunstkamara</key>
<short_description>This huge collection of natural curiosities and rarities is intended to educate and inform.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe museum was the idea of Peter the Great, and was built facing his magnificent Winter Palace in the purpose-built “window on the west” of St. Petersburg. The collection has a morbid, even prurient air to it, as it features a huge number of “natural curiosities” in the form of human and animal foetuses and still-births, all carefully preserved so that their details can be studied. The point, however, wasn’t simply to collect odd items for the sake of collecting oddities. Peter the Great wished to debunk the superstitions and fears of Russia which, even though he was the tsar, he regarded as backwards and ignorant.\n\nHe had little interest in collecting man-made objects, unlike the hunters and collectors of antiquities at other great museums of the time. Major collections of minerals, rocks and scientific instruments were added to the Kunstkamera (a word derived from Dutch). The museum survived as a single collection for around a century, then its collections were despatched to a variety of Imperial museums.</long_description>

<key>prest_russia_winter_palace</key>
<short_description>Peter the Great’s splendid building was intended to rival any royal palace anywhere in Europe or beyond.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt did so magnificently. The location in St. Petersburg was part of Peter’s policy of opening up to western ideas, where they were suitable for Russia, and his adoption of western architecture, culture and technology. The Tsar wanted his Palace to be the centrepiece of a “Third Rome” on the River Neva, and a new Imperial seat of government for all the Russias. It was deliberately built to be a palace rather than a fortress like the Kremlin in Moscow, although the wide prospects and avenues of St. Petersburg certainly made it entirely defensible by musket-armed troops.\n\nThe Palace remained as the official home of the Tsars for the next two centuries. It continued to play an important part in Imperial affairs until the end of Tsarist Russia and beyond. The 1905 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of unarmed protestors publicly demonstrated that the Tsar, for all the propaganda about being the “Little Father” of his people, had scant regard for the needs of ordinary folk. The storming of the Winter Palace in 1917 is an iconic moment in Russian history, the defining moment in the establishment of the Soviet state.</long_description>

<short_description>The fine arts are an ornament to any civilized nation. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Academy received royal approval in 1744, but it was not until the reign of Carlos III that it found a proper home in a former Baroque palace. This is somewhat surprising given that Carlos was a benevolent despot and rather fond of hunting. He was, however, also much given to public works and, more significantly for the advancement of the arts, had had a serious falling out with the anti-Enlightenment Jesuits. He suppressed the order in Spain and rendered the Spanish Inquisition largely ineffective.\n\nThe Academy included many artists of note, but surely its most distinguished master was Francisco Goya (1746-1828). Goya was supremely talented, and became the painter of choice in the Spanish court. His work marks a transition between the work of the “Old Masters” and the modern world to come: his painting “La maja desnuda” has been described as the first non-symbolic nude painting in the Western world. Sadly, he was tortured by deafness and illness in later life, and his painting took on a grimmer, darker feel.\n\nThe Academy is now home to a fine collection of paintings from the 15th Century onwards.</long_description>

<short_description>The Royal Palace is a suitable setting for any monarch with pretensions to rule much of the world.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOriginally a Moorish fortress when Madrid was ruled by the Islamic emir of Cordoba, and then a castle under the stewardship of the Christian kings of Castile, the site was not regularly used as a royal residence. The Antiguo Alcázar or Old Castle dated back to the 16th Century, but this burned down on Christmas Eve, 1734.\n\nKing Philip V, the first of the Bourbon rulers of Spain, ordered a new palace to be constructed. Perhaps he had it in mind to create a rival to Versailles, the palace of his grandfather, Louis XIV of France. In the event, he died before the construction work was complete and never lived in the New Palace, as it was only in 1764 that Carlos III occupied the building. As a setting for a monarchy, however, the palace had been well worth waiting for! It is vast: with 2800 rooms it is far bigger than any other European palace. \n\nIt is still the official residence of the Spanish monarchy, although it is only used for state occasions.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive collection of art would be an ornament to any nation.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Royal Museum was founded in 1792 by King Gustav III, and gave a home to his exquisite artwork collection. It now forms the core of the Swedish Nationalmuseum. \n\nGustav was an absolutist, as might be expected of a nephew of Frederick the Great of Prussia. He objected to parliamentary reforms, sought to distract everyone’s attention with an unsuccessful war against Russia and ignored public opinion. Although he was a playwright and a patron of music, the arts and sciences, and spent liberally on all of them, he did so without gaining much popularity among the people or nobles. His museum was the result of his free spending ways: where art was concerned, he was rather liberal with his money.\n\nIn the end, Gustav was assassinated by a conspiracy of noblemen at the Royal Opera House, an event that itself was turned into an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, Un ballo in maschera (The Masked Ball). Verdi had to change many of the details due to government censorship, as the assassination of a monarch was felt to be a bit too controversial in Italy of the 1850s.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nBuilt on the site of an older fortress called the Three Crowns, the current Palace is actually its second incarnation as the first building was destroyed in fire in 1697. The current version was designed by Count Nicodemus Tessin (the Younger), an able Baroque architect and city planner, and took the best part of 50 years to complete in brick and sandstone. Much of the surrounding city was also re-laid as moats and the like were filled in.\n\nThe Palace is still in use as the official residence of the Swedish monarchy, and houses significant museum collections, including the Livrustkammaren, or Royal Armoury within its 609 rooms. This is the oldest museum in Sweden, established by the great Gustavus Adolphus in 1628 when he decided to keep and display his equipment from his Polish campaigns. The various departments of the royal court and household are also still based in the palace, as are the Högvakten, the Royal Guard of the Svea Livgarde (Lifeguards), who have been a part of Palace life since the 1750s.</long_description>

<short_description>This naval school produces fine naval officers for Dutch sea service.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Dutch Navy owes its existence to the arming of Dutch trading ships in the 16th Century and earlier, often in direct contravention of orders from their Spanish overlords. The independently-minded Dutch were not minded to take much notice of such instructions. A centralised navy, dedicated solely to warfare, could trace its origins back to 1488, and had managed to dominate the seas for much of that time.\n\nA formal training system for officers, however, had to wait until 1785 when this land-based training establishment was opened. Before that, officers had learned their trade at sea, in a very practical way. The whole business was formalised under the short-live Republic of Batavia (1795-1806), although by this time maritime supremacy had passed to the British Royal Navy. Nevertheless, the Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart was one of the most prestigious naval schools, and produced fine officers.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nPieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778) left his fortune to the furthering of science and culture, as befitted a part-Scottish follower of the Scottish Enlightenment. He also left money for some almshouses for the poor folk of Haarlem. Before his death he had established various learned societies in the town and, like many gentlemen of the period, had a “cabinet of curiosities”: a large collection of objects of interest or antiquarian value. His fortune, made from the cloth trade, was certainly large enough to let him indulge in his passions for science and collecting.\n\nThe museum was a reflection of his interests, and was added to over the years so that it now has a fine collection of fossils, scientific instruments (and making them was something of a Dutch speciality), coins, paintings, prints and drawings. Pieter Teyler left a charitable and worthy legacy of a “Christian gentleman” in the museum and the almshouses.</long_description>

<short_description>Every new nation needs a birthplace.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\n Independence Hall in Philadelphia was actually built by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature as their State House, and so for the first two decades after completion it was home to part of the British administration in America. It is a practical, red brick building in a grand colonial style and has an architectural honesty and pleasing, human proportion to it that is sometimes lacking in grander neo-Classical structures.\n\nFrom 1775, the building was the home to the Second Continental Congress, the representatives of the Thirteen Colonies who approved the Declaration of Independence. The romantic view is that the “Liberty Bell” was rung to bring citizens to hear the reading of the Declaration in July 1776. Unfortunately, for romantics, historians now believe that the steeple of Independence Hall was in too bad a state to allow the ringing of any bells from the Hall. That hasn’t stopped the romantics believing the story for a minute! Independence Hall was abandoned by Congress when the British occupied Philadelphia from 1777-78. The government eventually moved to a specially created federal district (later to become Washington DC) when a mutiny by the Continental Army drove them out of Philadelphia in 1783. But for the actions of the mutineers, Philadelphia would probably still be the capital of the United States.</long_description>

<short_description>The Smithsonian is an establishment dedicated to learning and knowledge, with a world-renowned collection of objects and manuscripts.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe Smithsonian is not like other major museums, established to show off the collections of wealthy patrons or as an exercise in national glory. Instead, it is the legacy of a man who was neither an American nor visited the country. James Smithson (1765–1829) stipulated that his fortune was to be used for the “increase &amp; diffusion of Knowledge among men” if his nephew died without leaving an heir. With over pre-inflationary $500,000 in the fund, it took Congress nearly a decade to decide how to spend the money and the Smithsonian “Castle” in Washington was only completed in 1855.\n\nSince then, the Smithsonian has become one of the world’s leading repositories for historical objects and archives, funded by the US government and private donations. It now has 20 different branches, specialising in everything from ethnic art and objects to aerospace exhibits, and helping to manage the Smithsonian is one of the (very few) official duties of the Vice President of the United States.</long_description>

<short_description>Large plantations allow for capital investment in rice production and planning beyond the next harvest. Yields can rise as a result.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe key, of course, to all large estates is the profit to be made by the owners and a general increase in trade beyond immediate markets. Plantations are hacked out of the surrounding forests and land made productive if there is a home market to be satisfied. Foodstuffs always find a ready market, and rice is an easy commodity to ship without too much spoilage.\n\nHistorically, rice growing eventually became an important part of the economy in colonial Georgia and Carolina and, in turn, had a direct impact on the already-thriving slave trade. Slaves from rice-growing areas of Africa attracted a premium price because they were more useful to plantation owners, and this naturally influenced where slave traders procured their unfortunate wares. Knowledgeable Africans were victimised by the trade and shipped to America precisely because of their skills; a strong back was always useful, but a skilled labourer was much more useful – and profitable.</long_description>

<short_description>By introducing organisation beyond the simple hand-to-mouth methods of peasantry, rice yields are improved. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nRice does require extensive earthworks in terms of ditches, dykes and watercourses. Without a substantial and controllable supply of fresh water, crop yields will suffer. By moving away from a peasant-level growing pattern, where each farmer is responsible only for his fields and nothing else, a rice farm takes maximum advantage of the available land and water supply.\n\nAlthough rice is an important crop, it is not a complete diet in itself. The causes and cures of dietary “diseases” (actually, deficiencies) were dimly understood by 18th medical men, if indeed they were seen as being problems caused by poor diet at all. Doctors knew fresh food helped people with scurvy, but why this worked was a complete mystery. Other dietary mysteries, such as beriberi, were equally impenetrable. In that case, white rice, often seen as a higher-status dish than brown, un-husked rice, can be the cause of beriberi. Rice husk contains a relative large amount of thiamine (vitamin B1), the lack of which causes beriberi, a crippling condition. The causes and cure for beriberi, which was endemic in some parts of Asia, remained unknown until the early 20th Century.</long_description>

<short_description>Rice is a staple foodstuff for many people, and produces the best crops when grown in a system of flooded fields.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nPaddy fields require backbreaking labour by farmers to plant, maintain and harvest the rice crops. Flooded fields do not readily lend themselves to any kind of labour-saving devices, and all domesticated draft animals (other than the water buffalo) suffer when used to cultivate rice paddies. A large amount of manual labour is also required to maintain the elaborate system of waterways and dykes needed to keep fields flooded to the right depth. Too much water will ruin a rice crop just as surely as too little. All of this needs manual labour, a class of peasants to work the land constantly.\n\nHistorically, rice is one of the oldest cultivated crops; no one is quite sure when and where it was first domesticated. Humans have domesticated wild rice strains more than once in separate parts of the world, including dry field variants that grow like other cereals. Rice remains one of the vital food crops of the world.</long_description>

<short_description>Fields flooded for the specific use of rice growing; often created in and around areas of wetland.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCreating and maintaining a rice paddy is incredibly tiring and difficult. The flooded fields are hard to work and the water makes it impossible to use animals to lighten the load. A constant supply of water is required to keep the rice submerged and paddies are often in natural wetlands to make this process easier.\n\nRice was originally domesticated as far back as 3500 BC, but it only reached America in the 18th Century. It was introduced by the Spanish and proved to be a valuable product for those who learned how to grow it. Many obtained these skills from slaves they had brought from Africa.</long_description>

<short_description>These are roads where a considered effort has been made to improve the surface, and provide proper drainage for rainwater.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nConstructing roads allows local goods to reach nearby markets, and gives some useful work to paupers and work-shy individuals who would otherwise be moved on or require expensive charity. At the very least, the larger rocks have been moved out of the road, pounded to pieces and the resulting rubble used as a roadbed. Drainage ditches mean the road ceases to be a convenient gutter for rainwater, and a muddy hell for anyone trying to use it.\n\nHistorically, there was often a military imperative for building roads. Troops and artillery require good roads for strategic redeployments and rapid reaction. In Scotland, General Wade completed a network of roads to “Roman” standards during the 1720s so that armies could quickly move into the rebellious Highlands – the Jacobite supporters of the ousted Stuart dynasty were a constant threat. His achievement was celebrated in a (now defunct) verse of the then-new British anthem:\n\nLord, grant that Marshal Wade\nMay, by thy mighty aid,\nVictory bring.\nMay he sedition hush\nAnd, like a torrent, rush\nRebellious Scots to crush.\nGod save the King.</long_description>

<key>roads_cobbled</key>
<short_description>These are hardwearing roads paved with small stones, able to take much heavy traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBuilding a cobbled road is an incredibly laborious business. Each small paving stone must be shaped, placed and mortared into position. If done properly, the road also requires foundations, a careful camber to carry away rain water, and extensive drainage on either side. The end result is a fine road that is extremely durable, but not entirely comfortable for carts, carriages or foot traffic: cobbles can be hellishly bumpy!\n\nHistorically, the expense of cobbles, and the fine-looking result of cobbling a street, meant that they were often only used in or near towns or for high-status routes where the great and the good could not be expected to wallow in the mud like poor people. Cobbles, however, did serve the poor in another way: they were the perfect size for rioters! Levered out of place, they were the ideal thrown weapon (along with the half-house brick or “brickbat”) for a bit of informal remonstrating with any nearby unwelcome representatives of law and order.</long_description>

<key>roads_dust_tracks</key>
<short_description>These roads are the most basic of routes, linking villages and towns in a meandering fashion.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs a means of travel, the main benefit of a track is that it leads somewhere, probably – without local knowledge, it can be difficult to tell! Without signposts or markers, there is little to distinguish one path from another. Even local knowledge of a route can be limited, because locals rarely travel further than the nearest market town and possibly not even that far. The actual going is a little better than across open ground because at least large rocks and bushes have been removed. In wet weather, however, it may be considerably worse as the track turns to a muddy streambed.\n\nHistorically, these roads were often little more than drover’s tracks or country lanes that have been worn into the landscape by centuries of use. While perfectly adequate to local needs, they were not suitable for military purposes: heavy cannons in particular require solid going if they are to be moved at more than a snail’s pace, or at all!</long_description>

<key>roads_metalled</key>
<short_description>A metalled road is surfaced with small broken stones, providing a good, strong and long-lasting route for military and civilian traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe road is actually constructed in layers of increasingly large stones (going down through a cross-section), with each layer being compressed by rolling. The end result is a solid path that can drain cleanly. This method is often used for the key strategic and commercial routes between cities and defence points. Tolls are often charged to private users of such excellent roads and turnpikes.\n\nHistorically, “metalled roads” were only covered in “tarmac” after 1820, when the idea of using tar to stabilise the top layer of stones was tried by John Loudon McAdam (1756-1836), although “tarmac” itself was not called that until 1901!\n\nRoad building produced some other interesting characters, such as Blind Jack of Knaresborough, Yorkshire. Although completely sightless thanks to childhood smallpox, John “Jack” Metcalf (1717-1810) was, at various times, a fiddle player, an army recruiter, and a haulier. When a turnpike was built near his birthplace he used his local experience to create a masterpiece of a road, including a section on a raft of logs across a bog. His blindness was no handicap in bringing road projects in on time and to cost, although he was always at a loss to explain to others how he managed his finances so well.</long_description>

<short_description>A metalled road is surfaced with small broken stones, packed together to make a weatherproof route for military and civilian traffic.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe small stones form only the top layer: beneath are further layers of compacted stones and rubble, each compressed by both design and continuing traffic. The roadbed itself drains well, and can support large volumes of traffic and individually heavy items such as cannons.\n\nHistorically, the most famous and effective land route in world was probably the collection of toll roads and turnpikes known as the “Grand Trunk” in India. Much of it was little more than compacted dirt (mud in the rainy season) but large parts were well constructed. Trade, the lifeblood of the continent, and many armies, passed up and down the Grand Trunk over the centuries, from the wilds of the mountainous borders with Afghanistan to the rich provinces of the South. The Grand Trunk was also the murderous hunting ground of members of the Thuggee cult. These followers of the Hindu goddess Kali would befriend unsuspecting travellers, put them at their ease and then murder and rob them as an act of sacrament. Oddly, not all Thugs were Hindu; Muslims and Sikhs were found in their ranks, probably for the loot.</long_description>

<short_description>An academy is a “gentleman’s club”, of sorts, for the greatest minds of a nation to gather for discourse, lectures, debates and some very nice dinners. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAcademies concern themselves with all aspects of national cultural and scientific life. From the most abstract of mathematical conundrums to the collections of natural wonders and the study of languages and lexicography, nothing is outside the interests of academicians. The members are, by and large, selected by their peers, although individual governments do use their influence to secure places for worthy men – and these learned societies are not above granting membership to royalty in the hope of securing patronage!\n\nLarge projects were matters of national prestige. The Académie française, was charged with the collation of an official French dictionary. The epic voyage of Captain Cook, RN, in 1768–71 was partly influenced by the desire of the British Royal Society to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun from Tahiti. Other nations sent observers to, among other places, Canada and Siberia – Cook got the nicest destination! By observing the event from different sides of the Earth, parallax made it possible to calculate the size of the solar system and establish the astronomical unit.</long_description>

<short_description>An observatory is a centre for many scientific studies, not just astronomy. All the physical sciences are advanced here. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe study of the heavens leads to advances in mathematics, and improvements in scientific instrument making, horology and, perhaps most importantly of all, navigation and surveying. Accurate star charts and lunar tables (showing the phases of the moon) enable sailors to determine their position at sea, and a navy that can navigate accurately is one that can carry out its duties effectively. An observatory is also a centre for national prestige, as discoveries made and published reflect well on the institute and the nation that funds its work.\n\nHistorically, observatories were vital in the development of navigation and accurate clocks. This is why the zero-degree longitude line passes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London (until 1884 most states used their own nationalistic reference points). Indeed, the nationalism of astronomy often leads to ignorance of the observations and deductions of non-European astronomers.\n\nAstronomers could also be outrageous flatterers. After he discovered what he thought was a new planet, Sir William Herschel chose the name “Georgium Sidus”, or George’s Star, in a transparent bit of sucking up to his patron, King George III. Other astronomers flirted with the name “Herschel” then settled on “Uranus” for the new planet.</long_description>

<short_description>The residence of a sovereign should inspire awe and dread in equal measure, overwhelming lesser men by its magnificence.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThis magnificent structure is the beating heart of an empire, its nerve centre and the glory of the nation given physical form. Every carved detail, every piece of luxurious inlay, every painted ceiling, every tile on the floor, has been paid for by the blood and sweat of the nation’s people, and all to glorify the person of the monarch. The ruler and his state are one, for under an absolute system of government, all power resides in the person of the monarch. The court exists only to provide obedient servants, as an absolutist system can permit no rivals to the throne. The servants of the state must be kept firmly in their place, and made to remember that they wield borrowed (at best) power. The source of power needs a suitably magnificent setting, a public stage where upstarts can be broken and brought to heel, subtly or otherwise.\n\nAll royal palaces, no matter what culture produces them, represent a substantial investment of national wealth. From Versailles in France to the palaces of the Sultan in Istanbul, money was no object when it came to royal luxury. Taxes, after all, belong to the monarch in person, not the state.</long_description>

<short_description>This is the beating heart of the nation, where the representatives of the people meet to form a government for their sovereign.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn assembly of the great and good passes laws in the monarch’s name for the good order of the state, and not all these laws will be necessarily those wanted by the monarch. A good deal of hard-headed bargaining between the sovereign, his ministers and the parliamentary assembly ensures that while no one is ever entirely happy, no one is ever entirely excluded from the exercise and benefits of power. The assembled representatives allow the monarch to collect taxes and, in return, the state protects the liberties of subjects. The monarch is as bound by laws as his subjects.\n\nDespite the involvement of the people in government, there need be no broad franchise. Property requirements, social class and religious affiliation often limit the entitlement to a vote. However, that the monarchy bothers to consult its subjects even to a limited extent is a remarkable thing: the sovereign has ceded power to the people and stuck by this contract, recognising that mostly-willing subjects are better than unwilling slaves cowed into obedience.</long_description>

That it also adds gravitas to the representatives themselves is no more than mere coincidence.\n\nThe number of chambers and their methods of selection differ from republic to republic. Nearly all feature one chamber to pass laws and another to revise them.\n\nWhile the people may have a say in who creates the law, “the great and the good” usually take considerable pains to enfranchise only sections of the people. By carefully excluding voters thanks to age, sex, wealth, religion, birth and geographical location, the political classes can make public support a largely meaningless term. The less astute and largely unwashed masses of the people are important, but that does not mean they should interfere in government business!</long_description>

<short_description>A school offers education to the children of those willing to pay the fees. In some schools, subsidies from religious or charitable groups may be available. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is not a right or even considered much of a privilege in many societies. The skills of reading (a little), hunting, and beating recalcitrant servants are the only worthwhile accomplishments of “proper gentlemen”. A smattering of religious education puts a veneer of civilization on top.\n\nThe emerging middle and mercantile classes value education a good deal more highly, and pay for it to be drummed into their children! A few schools, mostly the work of charities and religious bodies, exist to teach the children of the deserving poor, or give orphans some kind of start in life.\n\nThe British system of state education and “public schools” (which are actually non-state, private schools) owes its confusing terminology to this period. Public schools were open to the public – the public who could pay – while private schools took pupils as they saw fit. British mass “state education” would have to wait for another century. State education existed in some countries, but always ran the risk of creating an imbalance between learning and obedient loyalty if it was extended much beyond those with a real stake in society.</long_description>

<short_description>This Catholic establishment educates those hoping to join the priesthood, making sure that their instruction is firmly rooted in Church dogma. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe syllabus concentrates on giving students the theological, spiritual and philosophical tools needed to carry out their duties, as well as a solid “Classical” education to produce men who will be well-respected members of society. Where science and the natural world are touched upon, it is always with an emphasis on how they reveal God’s grand plan of creation. A seminary is not intended to produce an enquiring mind, only a very disciplined one.\n\nHistorically, the seminary system owes its existence to the forces of the Counter-Reformation, a movement that aimed to defeat the heretical, Protestant views of Martin Luther and his ilk. The Council of Trent had recognised education as a weapon in its struggles against schism. The Church required an educated and intelligent group of priests, who could argue successfully in its defence. While the 18th Century is seen as the “age of Enlightenment”, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation had yet to play themselves out completely and the Church’s place in the hearts of men, affairs of state and God’s universe was still open to argument. In parts of Europe, the Catholic Church was still a tremendous force for social, political and scientific conservatism.</long_description>

<key>seminary_orthodox</key>
<short_description>A seminary produces the trained priests needed to maintain the hierarchy of the Orthodox Church and spread the Word of God.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nKept separate from the temptations of the world in a monastic setting, the students at a seminary are indoctrinated in matters of faith. They are given a solid, if conservative, education that will stand them in good stead when they become pillars of the community as priests: it is not their role to challenge the established order, but to minister to the people.\n\nHistorically, seminaries were also used to create a sense of national identity, particularly in Russia. History, culture and language were taught to students to give them a sense of belonging to the nation, so that they would pass this on to their flocks as well. In the late 19th Century, this nationalist and conservative education would be entirely rejected by one student. Study at the seminary at Tiflis in Georgia did not produce an obedient, respectful and compliant follower in Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili. Instead it turned him into “Koba” the bandit and gave him a taste for power and cruelty. As Stalin, he got the chance to indulge his taste.</long_description>

<key>settlement_fortifications</key>
<short_description>Defences constructed around a town will hold off many attacks, but cannot be expected to resist heavy attacks forever.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSettlement defences are seldom allowed to be truly impregnable defences. Practical matters such as cost, or the need to house a growing population, often stop city fathers from investing fully in their own defences. Instead, their defences are good enough to deter a casual attack, and good enough to hold up an enemy’s advance. Interlocking fields of fire can sweep attackers off the glacis as the defenders reap a terrible toll. It takes a disciplined approach to reduce a settlement’s fortifications to the point where a breach is “practicable” and the town can be taken.\n\nHistorically, town garrisons were often offered the “honours of war” and allowed to march away with their weapons, but only if they gave up without a fight. The townsfolk were likely to be spared any indignity. Once, however, the attackers had launched an assault then the town, its inhabitants and the garrison were fair game for any amount of pillaging and looting. The assault was a dangerous business, and a lawless orgy afterwards was often the soldiers’ reward.</long_description>

<key>settlement_fortifications_improved</key>
<short_description>As settlements grow there is a need for more elaborate defence in depth. The fortifications are designed to intimidate any attacking force, and then kill them.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nExtensive fortifications cost huge sums of money and much effort. There is little point in constructing them unless they are maintained and needed for the future survival and prosperity of a town. A defensive wall is good for a sense of security, but it does not feed a hungry family after a poor local harvest! As a practical matter, then, these fortifications are erected along borders and around towns of real strategic significance.\n\nThe defences are laid out according to the latest military fashions, and as well built as any purely military fortifications. This can cause local problems, as prime building land is either used for the forts themselves, or must be kept clear to provide excellent fields of fire. During long periods of peace, the city fathers must resist the temptation to cover the killing zones with houses and commercial properties!\n\nHistorically, fortresses created by Marshal Vauban of France dominated their towns for centuries. The defences of Strasbourg, in Alsace, are typical of his work, and were a clear geographical boundary until the end of the 19th Century.</long_description>

<short_description>Renting to tenants may not generate a high enough income for a landowner. It can be more profitable to displace people by an animal cash crop.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms can only generate so much income from rents. With an increase in town size, and an increased demand from industry for agricultural products, it is more profitable to have herds of animals, not a gaggle of tenants. Meat and wool demand increases rapidly as towns grow. Apart from any other considerations, moving people off land also creates large areas where landowners can indulge a passion for hunting. While this generates little income, it does give social status.\n\nThe “Highland Clearances” are probably the most famous example of a forced change to land usage on a large scale. Contrary to popular belief, Highland clan leaders carried out most of the Scottish clearances, driving their own kinsmen and clans into exile. The chieftains needed to pay for the sophisticated life that they could have in Edinburgh and London by reinventing themselves as Scottish gentry. Sheep simply earned more money than the crofters did.</long_description>

<key>sheep_great_estates_european</key>
<short_description>The largest estates can have a huge acreage turned over to the pleasure of their owners. Pleasure in a carefully manicured nature is secondary to the need to make money!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe largest estates are a statement of wealth, complete with dazzling palace-like grand houses in the latest styles and built without thought to the expense. Landowners and the great nobility vie with each other to produce not just houses, but idealized landscapes around them. Where the terrain is not dramatic enough, it is ruthlessly reorganised to suit the owner’s tastes. In the interests of art and beauty the workers, their homes, and their farms are removed from the land.\n\nHistorically, a group of landscape architects in Europe completely remodelled many country estates into idyllically perfect vistas for their clients. They created the fantasy of a natural landscape, improving on what was there to make entirely “artificial” (and this was not a term of disapproval at the time) parkland dotted with romantic ruins and gothic follies. In the process, men like Lancelot “Capability” Brown remade hills, flooded valleys, moved rivers, destroyed entire villages and displaced people without mercy. Many of these amazing houses and gardens still exist today, if only as tourist attractions.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThis is a pure statement of the nation’s wealth and power. No expense is spared in order to give the monarch a suitable setting. Apart from the landscape itself, which is carefully ordered to banish wild nature and the lower orders, the palace itself is a magnificent structure, unrestrained by any budgetary constraints. This is a setting for balls, masques, intrigues and plots, all under the watchful eye of the monarch and his inner circle.\n\nVersailles was probably the most magnificent example of this kind of palace. From the palace itself to the mock farm (complete with sheep washed in eau de cologne) for the Queen to play at being a shepherdess, no expense was spared. It was a very public projection of the wealth and prestige of the Bourbons and of France itself. The place was designed to overawe and confound lesser men with its sumptuous, sybaritic comforts.</long_description>

<short_description>The basis of all agriculture is the humble peasant, labouring in the field to bring in his master’s crops or to keep his master’s animals alive. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nDay-to-day life for a peasant farmer has barely changed in a thousand years. It is a short, hard life of abject poverty and backbreaking labour. He can expect nothing better than to work and die in the same village, tilling the same fields, his life bounded by the same horizon. Peasant farms are not terribly efficient: the landowners have little interest in anything beyond their rents and tithes. The problem for them is that peasant economies are, by their very nature, cash poor and most income is in kind, and there is a limit to where you can spend a goat!\n\nHistorically, life for a peasant was pretty much the same all over the world: work from dawn to dusk. In Russia, the peasants were serfs tied to the land and the property of the landowner as much as any cow or goat. In India, peasants were a caste locked into their social position by hallowed custom. The system eventually broke down in Western Europe thanks to industrialization needing a constant supply of workers and changes in land usage.</long_description>

<key>sheep_tenanted_farms_european</key>
<short_description>Tenant farmers are a huge social step up from the humble peasant. They may toil as hard, but they do so for their own profit not that of a distant master. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTenanted farms primarily produce cash crops. The landlord expects his rent to be paid, so subsistence farming is a waste of time, as it will not generate any income. Successful tenants, who develop the land, can become quietly wealthy men and may be able to buy their farms. \n\nFor a landlord the main benefit of tenanted farms is that income from them is in cash, not kind. Absentee landlords can therefore live the high life in a city; they rarely need trouble themselves with the mud and muck of the countryside – as long as they have trustworthy agents and tenants! A leisured class of “gentlemen farmers” and rentiers therefore arises, all thanks to the efforts of tenant farmers.\n\nHistorically, tenanted farms made good profit but, like all farming, were subject to the vagaries of the weather. Tenancies could be, and were, passed down the generations of families, something that allow tenants to see a point in developing “their” land with their cash surplus.</long_description>

<short_description>A shipwright needs somewhere to build ships, even if this is only a slipway and a timber yard – but any piece of firm foreshore will do for smaller vessels! </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe services of a smithy within the yard are also very useful, as most ships use a surprising amount of bespoke ironwork in their construction, not to mention hundreds of nails! A shipyard can produce smaller vessels and carry out repairs and maintenance too. Careening is a regular chore for wooden vessels: hulls become fouled with weeds and barnacles that cause drag and slow the vessel. A shipyard has all the gear necessary to empty a ship, then haul it onto a beach or slipway so that it can be scraped clean and washed by the tides.\n\nHistorically, shipyards needed a good source of timber close by, or were on the estuaries of navigable rivers (so that wood could be shipped from further inland to the yard). Buckler’s Hard on the Beaulieu River in the New Forest in southern England is a typical shipyard in where it was constructed. However, it is larger than many, and had an extensive staff of artisans and could handle two ships at once. The shipwrights of Buckler’s Hard built HMS Agamemnon, Admiral Horatio Nelson’s favourite ship, in 1781; many of the crew were equally attached to their captain, and followed him to later commands.</long_description>

<short_description>A large manufactory for producing the enormous numbers of weapons, blades and firearms, required for a contemporary army. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nCentralising the provision of weapons is a sensible thing to do when raising large armies: equipping recruits with standardised items standardises weapons drill and unit tactics, and makes supply issues easier to manage. It also cuts down on the chances of manufacturers supplying shoddy or downright dangerous firearms, something that is always a temptation for profit-minded contractors.\n\nA small arms factory does not replace private arms manufacturers. While the soldiers make do with government-made weapons, it is usual for officers to purchase their own equipment. Many craft-based armaments firms can thrive by making bespoke items for wealthy gentlemen.\n\nHistorically, the French Charville and British “Brown Bess Land Pattern” muskets were outstandingly successful designs, and remained in service for over a century each, with minor modifications. This standardisation was a major step forward in tactical and, more importantly, logistical terms. Armies could no longer entirely live off the land; ammunition and powder had to be made and sent to the troops. With standard designs, it also became possible to “cannibalise” damaged weapons for spare parts, something that was impossible if weapons were locally bought by individual regiments.</long_description>

<short_description>A plantation is an estate carved from the virgin forests of a new territory for growing one cash crop for export to the home market. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThere are tremendous profits to be made in growing crops to satisfy the demand for luxury goods in Europe and elsewhere. There are also tremendous risks: crops may fail, slaves may revolt and, once a cargo is gathered, the ships carrying it home may sink! \n\nPlantations are labour-intensive, especially during harvest time. They would not necessarily be profitable without indentured or slave labour. Slaves are self-explanatory, but indentured labour was the result of the European taste for transporting convicted felons to their colonies. Once a criminal arrived, several years of forced or cheap labour would be imposed on him or her, and this indenture could be traded to a plantation owner. It was possible to buy out an indenture and become free, an option that was rarely available to slaves. \n\nOriginally, the English word “plantation” was used to refer to any colony “planted” in a new location: even the Scottish settlers in Ulster were a plantation. There was no implication of farming one cash crop.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nPlantations can turn a large profit for their owners, providing the seasons are kind. The division of lands into small sections under a series of private owners means that profits can be made for personal gain. These profits can then be used to buy a plantation owner power and prestige within their society. As land-holding becomes concentrated in the hands of a few people, the chance for profit and for investment in those lands also grows. Income is not diluted into feeding many farmers and their families. \n\nWith large plantations it also becomes practical to hold slaves on a larger scale. The slave trade was not something that was carried out only by Europeans. Many Native American tribes were also in the habit of keeping slaves – both bought from traders and captured in warfare – to work their lands.</long_description>

<key>star_fort_earthworks_european</key>
<short_description>Star forts can be improved and extended with outlying earthworks and extra defences to make any attack a truly terrifying prospect. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe basic concept of a star fort is that at least one, and preferably many, field of fire should cover every part of the defence and the approaches to the fort. These killing zones can be extended and made even more deadly by, at the very least, a long sloping glacis around the fort for the attackers to scale. The glacis need not be very steep at all, but the attackers face an uphill struggle with no cover at all, under murderous fire ever step of the way. The glacis also acts as a passive defence, a sloping armoured earthwork for the fort proper. Beyond the glacis a hidden counterscarp awaits: a retaining wall (sometimes with firing positions for the defenders) that drops down deep ditch that must be crossed before the actual approaches to the fort are even reached!\n\nAll of these defences are before the military architects add additional ravelins (detached triangular bastions or gun positions) in front of the fort’s own walls and hornworks and crownworks (both elaborations on the basic bastion design). The whole effect, when viewed in plan form, is baroque in its complexity, each projection of the central star giving the defence another firing position towards any attacking force. Wall length is limited to that which can be covered by flanking musket fire, as experience showed that a fort with only cannons in its defence could be taken when the cannons were knocked out.</long_description>

<short_description>This imposing fort is a difficult objective for any attacker, and a clear symbol of power; cost is secondary matter after magnificence!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nBy European standards, this fortress looks like something of a relic from an earlier age, but to underestimate the defences would be very foolish. Packed earth ramparts behind the thick, high walls not only give extra fighting space to the defenders, but also deaden enemy cannon fire, absorbing the impact of shot and shell. Any attacker attempting to breach the defences must be prepared for a long siege, followed by a bloody and dangerous assault.\n\nHistorically, some of the most impressive fortifications ever constructed were the product of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The quality of workmanship demanded was extremely high, even palatial in its luxurious attention to detail. The Red Fort at Agra remains an outstanding example of Mughal architecture, a fusion of native Indian, Persian and Islamic styles that remains impressive even today. Over 3000 people lived within its walls at one point, and the defences were certainly capable of protecting many more.</long_description>

<short_description>A star fort is an enormous system of bastions and defensive positions with interlocking fields of fire: an intimidating obstacle to any attacker!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIn the Medieval period, castles had relied on high walls to make them impregnable and to give them a sense of overwhelming grandeur – part of their purpose was simply to intimidate lesser men. With the advent of gunpowder artillery, a different defensive scheme was required. Fortifications sank into the ground, protected by enormously thick walls, deep counterscarps and a sloping bank or glacis that would, hopefully, cause cannon shots to ricochet over the defences rather than penetrate.\n\nPassive defence, however, is not enough. The layout of projecting bastions in a star fort creates interlocking fields of flanking fire to destroy attackers as they approach over the sloping glacis. In theory, no attacker should reach the wall without coming under sustained and murderous attack from the defenders. The star shape evolved so that no part of the defences would be “blind” to fire from somewhere within the fort. The whole structure is, in fact, one massive killing zone for artillery weapons and defensive musketry. \n\nHistorically, the most notable creator of star forts was the French military engineering genius, Marshall Vauban (1633-1707); his name is virtually synonymous with the design. His defences at Verdun were still in use during the battle there in 1916 during the First World War.</long_description>

<short_description>This impressive fort is a major obstacle to any invader, and a powerful symbol of domination over the local people. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWith thick, high walls, impressive towers and many gun positions, the impression created by a fort for any attacker is of overwhelming strength. It will take time and effort to invest such a fort, break its walls with cannon fire and then organise an attack. All the while, the attackers will be prey to disease, starvation and the climate! The defenders may only have to wait for the attackers’ will to fail.\n\nBeyond Europe, the fortification ideas of Vauban and others did not really take root until the arrival of European powers and armies. Traditional fort designs continued in use because they were good enough for their purpose: they intimidated local rebels, and were difficult for them to assault because, as noted, they were unlikely to have substantial artillery siege trains. The “old fashioned” designs were therefore good enough when it took a courageous commander, or a lucky one, to mount a successful attack. There are, however, accounts of an Able Seaman Strahan single-handedly (!) capturing the “fort” (the size is not specified) at Baj-Baj on the Hooghly River in Bengal during Robert Clive’s 1756 campaign.</long_description>

<key>steam_drydock_european</key>
<short_description>A steam drydock is a magnificent achievement of an industrializing nation: a manufactory for ships without equal!</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe kind of beam engines used to pump water around a canal system (and drain mines) can drain a drydock efficiently. Using steam to power these engines is an obvious step, but once steam engines are in a dockyard their use goes far beyond pumping seawater around. \n\nThey can be used to drive sawmills, lathes, even block-making machines and as the lifting power for dockside cranes. The efficiency gains – admittedly with some new risk of fire, as the main shipbuilding material is wood – are impressive! \n\nThe scale of the military-naval industry could be huge in maritime nations, even discounting civilian yards. The British Royal Navy dockyards were the largest industrial organisation in the world during the 18th Century, and could make every part of a warship from a mast to a nail; guns were the exception, as they came from the Board of Ordnance. The ropewalk at Chatham, Kent, produced anchor ropes and was the longest brick building in Europe when constructed. It is still producing high quality ropes for ships today. The dockyards were so important that damaging them by fire or explosion carried the death penalty – something not actually repealed until 1971 (two years after the UK death penalty was finally abolished for murder).</long_description>

<short_description>This huge workshop creates the steam engines that provide motive power for other factories and their machinery; it is a birthplace of a new industrial age. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSteam-powered machines offer a way of creating unlimited goods of many kinds in an efficient manner. This enormous ironworks designs, develops and creates new static steam engines of many kinds, from the beam engines used to pump water out of mines, to the stationary engines used to haul plateway wagons, and the complicated expansion engines that provide power to other machines. Each new technical advance can be applied to work of the shop itself, and other manufactories soon benefit from any improvements, if they pay for the engineers’ work.\n\nThe “shock of the new” in the 18th Century was immense and nowhere more so than in the factories and mills that steam engines made possible. Workers’ lives were transformed overnight, and they had to master many strange new concepts: steam engines could be dangerous things. It’s worth remembering that many workers were killed by poorly installed or maintained engines, boiled alive thanks to steam explosions or mangled by a lack of safety features. Safety valves to release excess pressure were fitted not only to save lives, but also the expense of rebuilding if a boiler did explode!</long_description>

<short_description>Powered machinery allows enormous factories of all kinds to be built, and for profitable work to go by day and night.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nSteam engines can drive all manner of machines, from trip hammers to crushing mills, spinning machines to looms, lathes, drills and a hundred other devices. Anything that once relied on muscle power can be connected to a steam engine by a cunning contrivance of pulleys and drive shafts. Once an operator no longer provides mechanical power for a machine, he can either supervise many machines, or his job can be made less skilled. Either way, he does more work for his wages, and the mill owner feels the benefit. Because the heavy work is now done by machine, it is also possible for women and children to make a contribution to the workforce.\n\nThe “dark Satanic mills” that William Blake (1757-1827) wrote about and drew in his epic work “Jerusalem” (worked on 1804-20) really were shocking to everyone who encountered them. No matter where the mills and factories were built, they changed the landscape, poisoned rivers and skies, and brought new slums in their shadows. For sensitive people like Blake they truly were a vision of a new Hell on Earth, destroying lives in the search for profit.</long_description>

<short_description>A mill powered by steam engines can produce cheap goods of good, reliable quality on large machines.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nProfits from the mills can be enormous, as the machines run day and night, for as long as the steam engines have coal and water, and there are raw materials to process. Usually there is a central engine, and power for various machines is transferred by a series of axles and belt drives. Powered machinery is dangerous, and injuries among workers are common. This is particularly true among child workers, who are small enough to crawl beneath the looms and fix problems as they occur. It is all too easy to get caught in the whirling machinery and lose a limb, or worse.\n\nHistorically, workers saw steam power as a threat to their livelihoods. “Plug riots” where workers destroyed boiler plugs to render steam engines useless were common in Britain. The Luddite movement was so threatening that machine breaking was made a capital crime, and men were executed for it. The word French term “sabotage” originally referred to workers throwing their wooden sabots (shoes) into machinery to cause stoppages. The running of mills night and day did create jobs, but it also introduced the tyranny of obeying the clock through shift work.</long_description>

<short_description>A sugar mill allows the refinement of raw sugar cane into processed sugar, a delicacy easily transported to the almost insatiable home market. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA sugar mill takes sugar cane and crushes it to extract the juice: when powered by steam, the crushing gears can extract much more juice from the plants. The juice is boiled down until it crystallizes as sugar of various grades. As might be imagined, the process is hot (especially in tropical climes) and dangerous to the workers: injuries from being dragged into the machinery are not uncommon.  \n\nMilling improvements allowed more sugar cane to be processed, and make the whole process more efficient as well. Historically, even though European demand seemed to have no limits the price of sugar actually fell over time as manufacturing improved. A healthy trade in machine parts for mills also grew up between Europe and the sugar-growing regions.</long_description>

<short_description>As soon as a mine delves below the water table, water is a problem and flooding a constant danger. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nPumping or lifting the water allows the miners to reach richer, deeper mineral seams. A steam beam engine, linked to a pump, can lift enough water to make it economically sensible to dig deep shafts. \n\nHistorically, Thomas Newcomen was the first to develop a practical “atmospheric” engine for draining deep mines sometime around 1710. His design had problems and was very inefficient, but it worked well enough to be widely adopted where coal was cheap. It was an atmospheric engine because the steam was never under pressure, and relied on a partial vacuum forming when the steam cooled, thus sucking the piston down the cylinder. The need to repeatedly warm and then cool the machine made it wasteful. \n\nJames Watt’s beam engine design was altogether more efficient. He had a separate steam condenser, and kept the cylinder at a constant temperature. He was also lucky in his choice of working partner, Matthew Boulton, who proved to be an astute business manager and lobbyist: he even persuaded the British Parliament to extend their patent, guaranteeing them further profit!</long_description>

<key>stockade_european</key>
<short_description>A stockade is a simple defensive structure, quickly built from logs. Stockades always have a curiously temporary air, even if they have been in use for years.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe walls are logs driven vertically into the ground and sharpened at the top to make a crude, thick fence. When defended properly this is enough to keep out most attackers.\n\nThis is the reason why a firing step for troops is usually constructed inside using either banked turf or earth rammed up against the logs. This banking has the additional benefit of giving some resilience against light artillery fire. A stockade cannot be expected to stand up to a serious pounding by cannons.\n\nHistorically, they were common on the American frontier where they were used as patrolling bases for contingents of light troops and local levies. Often in North America a crude stockade and the European flag fluttering above it were the only indication that you had arrived in “civilized” territory.</long_description>

<short_description>Sensation and spectacle for the people can keep them occupied and entertained, not to mention distracted from politics.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA night at the theatre is a bawdy, rambunctious, rowdy, exciting, and novel experience. The theatre holds up a mirror to society, and sometimes society does not like what it sees. The audience show little respect, heckling is an art, and performers play to their claques rather than follow the text. Yet each great performance, each actor-manager, each new work, is eagerly followed by the chattering classes.\n\nHistorically, theatres could mean a great deal of trouble for the authorities. Riots were not uncommon if unpopular or provocative plays were staged, and David Garrick, the leading light of the London stage, was forced to kneel in apology before a fickle audience he had offended. They were in the process of completely wrecking his theatre and his livelihood! Because of this public excitability, and the potential for subversive propaganda, in the interests of “public morality” all governments closely monitored theatre performances. Indeed, Great Britain only scrapped censorship of theatres in 1968 when the Lord Chancellor’s Office no longer required London theatres to have approval for every production.</long_description>

<short_description>A house of pleasure, run by a bawd or pimp, where the business consists entirely of slaking the physical desires of anyone with the money to pay.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nOther than domestic service or labouring in the fields, there are very few ways that a woman can earn an independent living. Selling herself and her skills as a sexual partner are an obvious choice to many, and brothels provide a relatively safe place to work – certainly safer than the city streets. Male prostitution is not unknown, and some brothels cater for an entirely different clientele.\n\nHistorically, India had a tradition of raising lovemaking to a fine art. A significant portion of the Sanskrit “Kama Sutra” deals explicitly with sex, and another considers the acquisition and use of courtesans as lovers. This was an additional reason for the fascination of European traders and soldiers in India, far from home as they were, with the local women. A flourishing community of expatriates who were married to, or living with, native Indian women existed in the 18th Century. The somewhat bigoted ideas of “Victorian” morality and “muscular Christianity” among later cohorts of colonial administrators put paid to this and, ironically, brothels enjoyed a resurgent trade.</long_description>

<short_description>An enclosed section of a palace, where the concubines are secluded, ready for the pleasure of their master and away from the lustful gazes of other men. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe word came to English through Italian, where the Turkish “serai” (palace) was confused with the Latin word “sera” (door-bar). A “serai” was any grand palace built around a courtyard, not just a harem. Despite this confusion, there were separate quarters for concubines (Circassian girls were highly prized for their reputedly amazing good looks), and access was tightly controlled.\n\nThe whole idea of a seraglio became something of an obsession in Western Europe, and the subject matter of many works of art in “Turkish” Oriental style, which was quite popular during the 18th Century. Obviously, it combined the exotic and the naughtily erotic in tasteful pictures for the rich! The concept provided the inspiration for Mozart’s opera, “Die Entführung aus dem Serail” (Abduction from the Seraglio), where the hero attempts to rescue his love from the clutches of an Ottoman Pasha. First performed in Austria in 1782 under the (indirect) patronage of the Austrian Emperor, Joseph II, there has to be a suspicion that anti-Turkish sentiment informed the piece. Nevertheless, the opera was a success and personally very profitable for Mozart.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nApart from its obvious uses in construction and as fuel, timber is vital for shipbuilding. All vessels of the period are entirely wooden, and need hundreds of tons of good quality timber, of many kinds, each. Frames and structural members, for example, are made of oak. Buildings also use large amounts of wood both in the structure and during the building process as scaffolding.\n\nHistorically, the forests of the eastern seaboard of America were an extremely useful strategic resource, as they became an excellent source of the trees needed for masts and yards for the British Royal Navy. By their nature, masts need tall trees! Other types of timber became important cash crops, such as the mahogany found in the Far East, prized for its strength and beauty.</long_description>

<short_description>A water-powered lumber mill produces logs and sawn timber from the prime forests. Its semi-finished products can then be sold on local markets or shipped to the home market. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nIt is more efficient to ship half-finished planks and logs than tree trunks, thus increasing the profits from logging. Even though most of the equipment used is brought in from home, a lumber mill on a good site can easily repay the investment. The hard work needed to dig a mill pond and race, as well as carefully position a waterwheel is also handsomely repaid when a powered saw starts work.\n\nHistorically, it was possible for a logging operation to denude a forest of all of its profitable trees, in the process causing terrible environmental damage. Without the trees, the soil is soon gone, washed away in the first strong rains. It then becomes almost impossible for any kind of forest to re-establish itself. This worried hardly anyone in the 18th Century (there were exceptions – some men did go out of their way to plant trees so that navies would never be without supplies), as the world had been given to men to subdue, and there were always more trees in the next valley.</long_description>

<short_description>A massive enterprise controlling a nation’s trade to one part of the globe, or in certain commodities.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrading companies can be enormous, with fleets of armed merchant ships carrying all manner of cargoes. The successors to the medieval merchant adventurers, they generate fantastic wealth from their operations. Usually granted a government monopoly in either a geographic area or in a set of trade goods, the companies can also act as a privatised diplomatic service in distant corners of the globe. They are known to do deal with local potentates for trade concessions, military access, tax farming and they have taken over native governments by imposing their “advisors”.\n\nHistorically, the great East India companies of Britain, France and the Netherlands were armed, quasi-independent mercantile mini-states. The British East India Company was wealthy almost beyond imagining: its trade represented about one-sixth of the British national income. Like the French “Compagnie française pour le commerce des Indes orientales” and Dutch “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie”, the “John Company” had its own fleet and army. In India it fought wars and had its own foreign policy, giving the British government little choice but to support its actions. In modern times only petrochemical, mining and arms companies have commanded comparable power over nations.</long_description>

<short_description>Shipping goods of any kind by land is difficult and expensive. Any item that has to travel more than a few miles goes by ship wherever possible. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nMost roads are simply terrible, and bulk cargoes (such as coal) must go by ship anyway: it is the only way of moving goods cheaply and relatively quickly. It also makes the whole world a marketplace, even if the customers are not sure what to make of the goods they are being sent (British merchants insisted on exporting heavy woollen cloth to India for years, even though there was no obvious market for it).\n\nCoastal trade can also be very profitable. For example, a “cheese fleet” did nothing but shuttle back and forth between London and the northwest of England, bringing Cheshire cheeses to the London market. By a happy accident of geology, Cheshire had rock salt mines that provided a preservative for the local cheese to make the sea journey to London. Although salty, this was undoubtedly healthier than most food on a gentleman’s table in the 18th Century!</long_description>

The beasts are so revered that a breeder will bring his prized horses into his home in bad weather.\n\nThe Spanish conquistadors reintroduced horses to America during the sixteenth century. Their arrival had a profound effect on the Native American peoples and their way of life. It became a great achievement to steal the best horses from neighbouring tribes!</long_description>

<short_description>A sacred site where a tribe can honour its fallen warriors for all time.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA wide variety of burial customs are observed. Some believe that the air is important to the passing of their loved ones. Thus wooden scaffolds are created and the dead placed on top, so their spirit may pass into the wind. Others believe the spirit must be kept with the body after death and thus build ‘spirit houses’ to trap the spirit. These little wooden structures can take many forms, some even look like miniature houses standing over the body.\n\nBurial rites are often closely tied to tribal totems: eagle-related tribes, for example,  always place their dead on scaffolding. A bear totem tribe often buries the dead in wooded areas, and so on.</long_description>

<short_description>A games field allows warriors to practice battle skills with their brothers-in-arms without risking death.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA man’s skill and courage is not only forged in battle, but also through competition on the games field. Taking part means warriors have to pit their wits against more evenly matched opponents. Sports also improve a village’s morale: fun is a welcome change from the work of the day.\n\nHistorically, many of the native tribes played ‘the ball game’ which bore many similarities to lacrosse. Teams of ten or more men represented their village or tribe, and each player carried two small sticks, not the rackets now used in lacrosse. The object of the game was to drive the ball through the opposing team’s goal; the goals were about 150 yards or metres apart. The ball game was incredibly rough and fiercely competitive, a bloodsport in all but name.</long_description>

The spearing skills and equipment used by each man are the same as for freshwater fish. Once taken, fish can be smoked or salted to last the long winter months.\n\nHistorically the North American tribes did not really have the sailing technology to exploit the vast stocks of sea fish that were to be found off the coast. However, given that the potential of this food source was demonstrated by the Europeans, it is likely they would have exploited it given the chance.</long_description>

<short_description>With the desire for furs ever increasing, trading in them is a lucrative business.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTrading in fur can often be a long-winded affair until the final customer is reached, as moving furs from the wilderness relies heavily on finding river routes to transport them. The use of wooden canoes allows the furs to be sent great distances in a much shorter time than if they had been sent by land.\n\nHistorically, many European outsiders that became &apos;woodsmen&apos; actually took up the native way of life, adopting their clothing, lodgings and customs. Some married native women, thus creating bonds to the tribe that came with the benefit of free and easy trade.</long_description>

<short_description>The High Chief has the final say, and his dwelling reflects his status</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nTribal structure relies on everyone knowing his place and recognising where power is vested. The tribal sub-chiefs need a supreme leader to bring them together, to be a voice for the people. The High Chief fulfils this role, acting as father to his tribe with, if he is wise, the guidance of the medicine men and older warriors.\n\nHistorically, tribal leaders were the key in determining tribal policies, especially towards the invading Europeans. King Philip’s War of 1675-6 seems to have been the result of Metacomet (or “King Philip” as the English settlers called him) realising that trading tribal lands for goods was the height of folly, despite what previous leaders had done.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nThe life of a warrior is one of blood and filth in battle; more than that, from time to time the soul needs cleansing too. Though similar to a sauna in that it is a hot confined space, the sweat lodge is a spiritual place rather than somewhere for rest and relaxation. The intense heat purifies and focuses meditation, opening up the paths to new sacred knowledge.\n\nThe sweat lodge was traditional to almost all the native tribes but each had their own version. In the northeast, the frames of the lodge were made of willow and covered in birch bark or animal skins; in the southeast the lodges were earth mounds or built into a hillside. The Plains tribes covered their sweat lodges in buffalo hides; even the Inuit tribes of the far north used sweat lodges. However, as European missionaries sought to convert tribesman to Christianity they saw the sweat lodge and its use as a spiritual gateway as a threat. They were often banned on reservations.</long_description>

<short_description>A warrior society allows the recruitment of military units and adds to the experience of bow-armed units.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThere is no greater measure of a man than how he handles himself in warfare; it is an honourable pursuit for a Native American. When needed, peasants and farmers can take up arms to fight for survival, but real warriors are needed if there is to be any proper defence against invaders. A warrior society instils a sense of courage and honour in the tribe’s fighters, as well as laying the groundwork for training in the arts of ambushing.\n\nWarrior societies played an important role in tribal life. They provided warriors with a social structure and gave them prestige within the tribe. Each society had its own distinctive rituals and encouraged bravery through rivalry with other societies and the promise of higher society rank. Although these positions provided great respect and privileges they also came with huge personal sacrifices for an individual. A ‘bear-belt wearer’ in the Big Dog Society of the Crow, for example, was expected to walk straight up to the enemy during battle and never, ever retreat no matter what happened.</long_description>

Ice fishing in winter is a cold, lonely and slow business compared to using nets and lures in spring.

The Warrior Society units that are furnished with such guns enter battle with confidence in, and knowledge of, in their weapons.

The earliest example discovered so far was the Falling Creek iron works, established by the Spanish. It included the first blast furnace in America, and a water wheel that was powered by the nearby James River falls. The ironworks met its end in the summer of 1622 when the Powhaten tribe, led by Opchanacanough, organised a series of raids on the James River area. Falling Creek was burnt to the ground.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nLong houses are similar to wigwams, in that they use a wooden pole frame covered with elm bark. There are holes at intervals along the roof to allow smoke from the fires burning inside the building to escape. During the winter months the two main entrances are covered with animal pelts to keep out the cold winds. \n\nLong houses are big enough for an entire extended family or clan and have raised platform areas for sleeping mats, leaving large areas of the lower floor for socializing.</long_description>

<key>tribal_prospectors_camp</key>
<short_description>Gold is a source of wealth and Europeans have the ability to mine it, but at what cost to the Spirits of the land?</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA prospector’s camp is a collection of hardy men, survivors of the worst that the wilds can impose on a man. They are experts at reading the land and finding gold in the most seemingly unlikely of places. Some work with the permission of the native tribes, paying for the right to stake a claim and extract wealth. In return for allowing this small scale invasion of their lands, the tribes get a share of the wealth and power that gold produces.\n\nGold was one factor that brought Europeans to the Americas in search. While the Spanish never found “El Dorado”, they certainly found gold. Gold &quot;in them there hills&quot; was enough to start stampedes of the greedy, the desperate, and everyone else in search of riches. The really big gold rushes were in the 19th Century (California, the Black HIlls of Dakota, and Klondike), but a smaller rush in Georgia was possibly triggered by the native tribes mentioning that they had found gold on their lands. The tribes and their beliefs in the Spirits were brutally ignored in the dash for wealth.</long_description>

<key>university_european</key>
<short_description>A university offers young men of good standing the finest of educations and the chance to study with the greatest minds of the age.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nEducation is vital for those who wish to enter the professions, or make their way in government using talent alone. A good, well-trained brain is an excellent substitute for birth and social connections. A young gentleman’s studies can be wide ranging, and need not be tied to any particular faculty or subject area – an awarded degree or doctorate is proof enough of intellectual achievement.\n\nHistorically, in Europe at least, the established church controlled most universities, either through paying for them or by laws requiring the tutors to take holy orders. Sir Isaac Newton was very unusual in that he didn’t take orders when he was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge (a post currently held by Stephen Hawking), arguing that the post required the holder to spend time on science, not the Anglican Church. However, the requirement for teachers to accept Church doctrine did mean that universities had a socially conservative outlook. While scholarships were available, students had to have money to attend, reinforcing this conservatism. While wild, threatening ideas about the world and the way it worked did emerge from universities, the institutions were rarely radical or revolutionary breeding grounds.</long_description>

<key>vineyards_european</key>
<short_description>A vineyard is a farm dedicated to the growing of grapes and the production of wine, but on a relatively small scale. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nWine is one of the pleasures of life for all classes in society and, along with ale, is the standard drink of many Europeans thanks to poor quality water supplies in towns and cities. No one actually cares about the public health implications of wells and open sewers in close proximity to each other!\n\nThe patterns of growth and consumption of wine in the 18th Century often had some odd roots. The British taste for “claret” (Bordeaux wine) dates back to the Middle Ages when the English monarchy controlled the region. Much of the earliest “New World” wine is supposedly the result of plantings by the Catholic Church to ensure that they had a supply of wine for Mass. Grape varieties can have similar odd origins: Shiraz, for example, started as Syrah grapes, originating in Persia and were brought back to France around the time of the Crusades. There were many more local grape varieties than today, because pests from America wiped out older types in the 19th Century.</long_description>

<key>water-powered_cloth_mill_european</key>
<short_description>A water-powered mill allows the operation of large weaving machines, beyond what human muscles can power and, consequently, larger profits.  </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe waterwheel is one of the oldest sources of motive power in the world. Watermills have been grinding flour since Classical times, and used to power tools for nearly as long. Ultimately, waterpower relies on gravity. Damming streams to make millponds to provide a head of water is futile unless the water is there in the first place; the expense is pointless if the mill itself is not a lot lower than the water supply. Steep-sided valleys and plentiful rain therefore determine where watermills are likely to be economically viable propositions.\n\nOnce the waterwheel is turning, it drives a series of axles. Individual machines take power by a pulley-and-leather-belt system. This limits the overall size of the mill, because a wheel can only drive a limited number of machines thanks to friction and the fundamental inefficiencies of a gearless drive. Thanks to few or no safety features – and leather strapping moving at high speed – a mill is a dangerous place to work. Any unlucky worker trapped by the machinery will be crippled or killed in seconds, and probably have their wages stopped for causing the mill owner to lose profits during the cleaning of blood and body parts.</long_description>

<key>weavers_cottages_european</key>
<short_description>The move from very traditional craft workshops to a more formal “cottage industry” allows trade and manufacturing to expand significantly.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nA “cottage industry” is literally that: one where whole families live and work in their cottages at the same craft. Once the whole community is engaged in the same trade, output can be relatively substantial, but limited by the skills of the workers. There is some division of labour involved: family women tend to be the yarn producers, while men operate the manual looms. From dusk to dawn, the machines have to work in order for families to survive: they are paid piecework rates, so must work quickly.\n\nHistorically, weaving was a substantial industry but entirely cottage-based before the rise of water and steam-powered mills in Yorkshire, England. Cloth and “piece” halls in market towns allowed the consolidation of bulk shipments from many small suppliers. The system, however, was incapable of producing goods of a consistent quality (as each weaver worked to his own standards), and could not be scaled to match demand. Artisans took years to master their trade, not the weeks it took to install a new machine in a powered mill.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nWool is a by-product of farming sheep for food, and weavers can make it into useful cloth for trade and clothes. To begin with, weaving is a “home industry”, but eventually there is enough work to make specialisation worthwhile. \n\nThere are other forms of weaving, of course. Basketwork is an important craft for many tribes, if only to create storage for grain and food to last the harsh American winters.</long_description>

<key>western_artillery_fort_european</key>
<short_description>An artillery fort is a permanent defensive structure, mounting as many heavy guns as the builders can afford to emplace. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has strong walls and parapets with embrasures: gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. Properly served and loaded with grape or canister shot, guns turn the approaches to the fort into death traps for any attacking infantry.\n\nThe fort has to be strongly constructed to withstand repeated pounding by attacking cannons, and by the recoil of its own pieces. Repeated firing by even small cannons, such as nine-pounders, causes tremendous strains on the structure. The other risk to the fort is, of course, fire. While the fabric of the building itself will not burn, the magazine holding the powder and shot for the fort can catch fire and explode.\n\nHistorically, it was not unknown for defenders to blow their own forts up, by accident or design. The powder magazine was a dangerous place, and required rigid adherence to correct procedures by everyone if disaster was to be avoided. On one occasion at Fort York, during the War of 1812, the defending British set off the magazine as they withdrew to deny the contents to the American attackers, killing hundreds of the assault force in the explosion.</long_description>

<short_description>A wine estate represents a substantial investment in vines, land and time. Wine is lovingly produced, carefully aged, and sold on at a premium. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe entire process is still subject to the vagaries of weather, soil and time. It is quite possible for an estate to produce a truly great wine one year and a foul one the next because, while standards are improving, there are still a great many variables that are only dimly understood. \n\nIn some parts of the world, a great wine estate is a prestigious possession, over and above its economic value. \n\nAnd the value could be great indeed: the 18th Century was a time of prodigious boozing in Europe. Georgian Englishmen, for example, apparently had bottomless gullets even by contemporary standards, as the available water was not always fit to drink. Contrary to the popular belief of the time, excessive drinking was not the cause of gout (an agonising inflammation of the joints) only a contributory factor. Gout is triggered by a high-protein diet (as favoured by the wealthier classes of the period), and the liberal use of toxic lead compounds to sweeten wine probably did little to help matters!</long_description>

<short_description>A winery takes the product of several vineyards and produces wine on a large scale, shipping much of it in casks to distant markets. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nGlass is expensive, and it is better to ship casks to market and then have the consignment bottled by wine merchants to suit local tastes. The casks can then be broken down for easy shipment back for refilling. The maturing process in the casks is a happy accident that improves the flavour of the wine!\n\nThe 18th Century was a period when food adulteration was common – whitening flour with chalk, for example – and wine was no exception. Watering was the least offensive and probably safest practice, as the alcohol would kill infectious parasites and germs in the water. Also common was the practice of sweetening wine by adding various chemicals, including lead. Lead was known to be poisonous, but without legislation to protect customers, there was nothing that could be done to stop vintners adding whatever they wanted to wine.</long_description>

<long_description>\n\nAn artillery fort has a strong wall and parapet that is set with embrasures, gaps for cannons to fire through at attackers. \n\nThe repeated firing of even quite small artillery pieces, even six-pounders, puts a tremendous strain on any structure. An artillery fort therefore requires a lot of timber for bracing, and a considerable amount of manual work to create the required earthworks. These do make the structure better able to resist bombardment by attackers, but no timber structure, even one backed by earthen banks, can stand forever against artillery. \n\nA wooden artillery fort commands the surrounding landscape, and is a significant strategic obstacle to any invading force. Its imposing walls also give notice that its builders intend to keep the land they have occupied.</long_description>

<short_description>A wooden fort is a substantial defensive work, built from logs and with supporting earthworks.</short_description>
<long_description>\n\nAs a defensive work, it is well able to withstand enemy attacks when properly defended by stalwart men; a garrison should expect to hold out against attacks for some little time. The walls are high enough to give a good firing position to any defenders, and any aggressor had better bring a ladder or particularly acrobatic attackers to a siege! The walls are only the most visible part of the defence: the surrounding trees and undergrowth are cut back to provide a clear firing – and therefore killing – ground for the defenders. This cleared ground often extends well beyond musket range, to deny attackers the chance to approach unseen.\n\nUnlike a stockade, a fort is a relative permanent structure and, as such, it serves to mark ownership of territory as much as to command the surrounding area. Forts are positioned with an eye to using the existing terrain, commanding any strategic approaches (such as passes and river crossings) and intimidating the natives.</long_description>

<short_description>This establishment provides higher education to any who desire instruction in religious matters and for those seeking positions of authority. </short_description>
<long_description>\n\nThe syllabus concentrates on traditional Islamic areas of study, and emphases the philosophical underpinnings of faith, the theological and spiritual orthodoxies, and the legal implications of following the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The result is a highly educated man, who can act as a scholar in the wider community, but has the intellectual and practical abilities needed to hold many government positions. The graduates of a yüksekokul can be relied upon to carry out their duties with diligence.\n\nHistorically, the Ottoman Empire relied almost entirely upon its Muslim population for administrators at every level. Minority religions were granted legal protections and treated leniently, but it was almost unheard of for a professed Christian or Jew to reach a position of high authority. Although education was valued, the janissaries did have something of a military stranglehold on the administration of the Empire. Inherently resistant to change, the janissary administrators were a deadening force in the intellectual, political and scientific life of the Empire.</long_description>
